10101316,Configuring Reference Models - An Integrated Approach for Transaction Processing and Decision Support,"Reference models are of normative, universal nature and provide a solution schema for specific problems by depicting best or common-practice approaches. The configuration of these reference models has been a field of research in the past. However, the integrative configuration of different reference models or respectively reference models serving multiple purposes lacks of applicable methods. In practice this is a common problem as the simultaneous implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and a management information system shows. We provide a method that allows the integrative configuration of conceptual models for transaction processing and decision support by integrating meta models for modeling languages. In addition, we exemplarily show its application to extend an existing reference model.","['Configuration', 'Decision support', 'Integration', 'Methods', 'Reference models', 'Transaction processing']","['Configuration, Decision support, Integration, Methods, Reference models, Transaction processing']",en

Scalability research has focused on two directions: (1) redesigning the Blockchain protocol, and (2) facilitating ‘off-chain transactions’ and only consulting the Blockchain if an adjudicator is required. In this paper we focus on the latter and provide an overview of Bitcoin payment networks. These consist of two components: payment channels to facilitate off-chain transactions between two parties, and the capability to fairly exchange bitcoins across multiple channels. We compare Duplex Micropayment Channels and Lightning Channels, before discussing Hashed Time-Locked Contracts which enable Bitcoin-based payment networks.

The client bandwidth is incorporated to stream distribution, so that every client that receives the stream forwards it as well. ALM systems are usually classified in push, pull and hybrid approaches [1]. In the remainder of this article we are focusing on live-streaming, which imposes strict delay constraints on the content distribution and thus cannot be realized with pull-based approaches. Hence, we concentrate on push-based ALM that splits a stream in multiple substreams (so-called stripes) by using Multiple Description Coding (MDC) and assigns each of them a separate spanning tree. However, the results of this article apply to hybrid and partially to pull-based approaches as well. © 2011 IEEE.",,,en

In contrast to other approaches attempting to transfer each existing function in a company into a service, the method presented in this paper proposes a selective identification of services from a business point of view, based on process models. Functions are rated due to their outsourcing and visibility potential for stakeholders. Functions are only implemented and provided as a service, if both business potential and technical feasibility have been verified. Having been evaluated in a medium-sized manufacturing company, the approach and the results of the evaluation can also facilitate a sound service identification in other companies.","['Process model analysis', 'Production planning', 'Service identification', 'SOA', 'Stakeholder']","['Process model analysis, Production planning, Service identification, SOA, Stakeholder']",en

12237767,Unified Enterprise Knowledge Representation with Conceptual Models - Capturing Corporate Language in Naming Conventions,"Conceptual modeling is an established instrument in the knowledge engineering process. However, a precondition for the usability of conceptual models is not only their syntactic correctness but also their semantic comparability. Assuring comparability is quite challenging especially when models are developed by different persons. Empirical studies show that such models can vary heavily, especially in model element naming, even if they are meant to express the same issue. In contrast to most ontology-driven approaches proposing the resolution of these differences ex-post, we introduce an approach that avoids naming differences in conceptual models already during modeling. Therefore we formalize naming conventions combining domain thesauri and phrase structures based on a linguistic grammar. This allows for guiding modelers automatically during the modeling process using standardized labels for model elements, thus assuring unified enterprise knowledge representation. Our approach is generic, making it applicable for any modeling language.",Knowledge Management; Information Modeling; Naming Conventions; Corporate Language,"['Knowledge Management', ' Information Modeling', ' Naming Conventions', ' Corporate Language']",en

12238763,Towards Tool Support for Information Model Variant Management – A Design Science Approach,"Information models are important instruments for deciders in enterprise engineering because they help structure the environment which is subject of a reorganisation task. The perspectives on the enterprise differ depending on engineers and tasks. This is why the number of models is increasing in enterprises as more different user groups exist. This can cause a lot of redundant work and inconsistencies. This paper reports on a design science approach to develop a modelling tool which is able to provide specific variants of information models, which are aligned to the different perspectives of user groups. Therefore the tool supports a set of configuration mechanisms, which are specialised on the definition of certain kinds of differences between the model variants. The supported differences concern model elements and concepts of the modelling languages including their representations and designations. The relevant kinds of differences were identified by explorative case studies and a survey of experts. The configuration mechanisms were conceptualised by data models in a search process divided in two steps. A prototype shows the feasibility of the developed concepts.","['Design Science', 'Meta Modeling', 'Model Variant Management', 'Multi-perspective Information Modeling', 'Tool Support']",,en

Therefore many of these ES, such as SAP R/3, are provided with preconfigured processes and data objects that can be regarded as best-practice and which are documented by reference information models. Customizing can be accelerated if these models are used for the customization process. This requires profound configuration and adaptation mechanisms that encompass variants due to specific customer needs. To ensure continuous improvement towards a shorter customization time and reduced cost, controlling of the adaptation process becomes a crucial task. This controlling aims at improving the reference model basis and their configuration mechanisms. Therefore we introduce configuration mechanisms that can be used to adapt reference information models due to company characteristics. Afterwards the configuration mechanisms are interpreted by the ES to perform the necessary customization steps.","['Control system synthesis', 'Costs', 'Companies', 'Context modeling', 'Adaptation model', 'Sections', 'Information systems', 'Business process re-engineering', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Acceleration', 'business data processing', 'enterprise resource planning', 'enterprise system', 'preconfigured processes', 'reference information models', 'customization process', 'customer needs']","['EGovernment, Process management, Process modelling, Process oriented reorganisation, Reference modelling']",en
12238999,Experiences in Process-oriented Reorganisation through Reference Modelling in Public Administrations - The Case Study Regio@KomM,"During the last years the optimisation of business processes has gained more and more importance in the context of modernising public administrations. In line with the concept of electronic government (eGovernment) citizens demand not only an improved design of internet sites, but also the creation of real added value to administrational services. In dimensions of benefits (from the citizen's point of view) and in dimensions of cost reduction (from the administrations' point of view) the added value can be generated by providing fully transactional online citizen services. The establishment of such services should be supported by reorganising the underlying business processes in terms of process organisation and enabling ICT. Approximately 13,000 German municipalities mainly have to deal with the same spectrum of tasks. The administration processes that are necessary to fulfil those tasks share strong structural analogies. Within process oriented reorganisation projects, reference models can contribute to cost reduction in the phase of to-be modelling. Aim of this paper is to present experiences in applying reference modelling within the process oriented reorganisation project Regio@KomM in public administrations.

In order to increase the quality of operations and processes, reference process models can be used as a valuable design support. Reference process models show a high level of reusability and thus allow for an extensive exploitation of synergy potentials as well as a reduction of redundancies. For the design of reference process models public administrations need to identify the best practice or common practice within the regarded domain. In order to support the identification of best practice or common practice a communication platform is needed that contains process descriptions of the specific administrations that can be provided by the administrations themselves.

The configurative reference modeling approach promises support for the model developer as well as for the model user, as certain parts of a model can be automatically removed with respect to the requirements of a certain perspective. By this automation, the risk of creating faulty models during adaptation can be highly reduced. However, up to now this approach exists in terms of its conceptual specification, leaving software support to a proprietary prototype, not providing support for widespread modeling tools, which is necessary for acceptance and applicability of the approach. To face this gap, our approach proposes an XML schema, enabling the configuration of serialized conceptual model data of virtually any modeling language and any modeling tool capable of XML export.",Information Modeling; Configuration; XML; Interchange; AML; CML; Conceptual Modeling,"['Web 2.0', ' Internetökonomie', ' Websuche', ' Suchdienste']",en

Such processes often comprise of both well-structured, transactional parts and creative parts that often cannot be specified in terms of their process flow, required resources, and outcome. Moreover, the processes' high variability sets boundaries for the possible degree of automation. In this paper we introduce the concept of pockets of creativity as an analytic device which is hoped to support process managers in their efforts to identify and describe creative sections in business processes. We argue that this step of identifying and describing is imperative to successfully allocate resources, integrate creativity into the overall process, and introduce process automation for those parts that are well-structured and can actually be automated. Our argument rests in the examination of existent literature as well as in findings from exploratory case studies that were conducted in the film and visual effects industry in order to study processes that rely on creativity.","['Business process management', 'Creativity management', 'Media industry', 'Workflow']",,en

12239743,An Ontology-based Service Discovery Approach for the Provisioning of Product-Service Bundles,"More and more traditional manufacturing companies form or join inter-organizational networks to bundle their physical products with related services to offer superior value propositions to their customers. Some of these product-related services can be digitized completely and thus fully delivered electronically. Other services require the physical integration of external factors, but can still be coordinated electronically. In both cases companies and consumers face the problem of discovering appropriate product-related service offerings in the network or market. Based on ideas from the web service discovery discipline we propose a meet-in-the-middle approach between heavy-weight semantic technologies and simple boolean search to address this issue. Our approach is able to consider semantic relations in service descriptions and queries and thus delivers better results than syntax-based search. However - unlike most semantic approaches - it does not require the use of any formal language for semantic markup and thus requires less resources and skills for both service providers and consumers. To fully realize the potentials of the proposed approach a domain ontology is needed. In this research-in-progress paper we construct such an ontology for the domain of product-service bundles through analysis and synthesis of related work on service description. This will serve as an anchor for future research to iteratively improve and evaluate the ontology through collaborative design efforts and practical application.","['Ontology', 'Ontology design', 'Product-service bundles', 'Service discovery']",,en

A basic challenge can be seen in information requirements engineering. On the one hand, users need certain information to successfully accomplish their tasks. On the other hand, it has to be avoided to supply them with too much and potentially irrelevant information. Information requirements engineering has to support the conceptual specification of information requirements. Thus, there is need for conceptual languages and appropriate procedure models. We propose a procedure model for the analysis and conceptual design of reporting systems as well as a conceptual modelling language that can be used for both as-is analysis and to-be modelling. It has been developed in an iterative approach based on multiple case studies. Due to the fact that different projects and different basic conditions require the use of different approaches of information requirements engineering, within the procedure model different approaches can be used. In this paper we introduce both procedure model and conceptual modelling language and present findings of a case study in which they were used. © 2006 Stefan Seidel, Ralf Knackstedt and Christian Janiesch.","['Case study', 'Conceptual modelling', 'Data warehousing', 'Information requirements engineering', 'Reporting']","['Citation Analysis, CoAuthorship, Knowledge Economy, Knowledge Sharing, Online Literature Databases, Rankings, Reputation Competition, Research Cooperations']",en

Many of today's IS curricula are biased toward large ERP packages. Nevertheless, these ERP systems are only a part of the ERP market. Hence, this chapter describes a course outline for a course on medium-sized ERP systems. Students had to study, analyze, and compare five different ERP systems during a semester. The chapter introduces a procedure model and scenario for setting up similar courses at other universities. Furthermore, it describes some of the students' outcomes and evaluates the contribution of the course with regard to a practical but also academic IS education.",Diversity; ERP; Enterprise resource planning; Course outline; Case study; Teaching; IS education; University; Information systems,,en

12241767,Pockets of Creativity in Business Processes,"Creative processes, for instance, the development of visual effects or computer games, increasingly become part of the agenda of information systems researchers and practitioners. Such processes get their managerial challenges from the fact that they comprise both well-structured, transactional parts and creative parts. The latter can often not be precisely specified in terms of control flow, required resources, and outcome. The processes&rsquo; high uncertainty sets boundaries for the application of traditional business process management concepts, such as process automation, process modeling, process performance measurement, and risk management. Organizations must thus exercise caution when it comes to managing creative processes and supporting these with information technology. This, in turn, requires a profound understanding of the concept of creativity in business processes. In response to this, the present article introduces a framework for conceptualizing creativity within business processes. The conceptual framework describes three types of uncertainty and constraints as well as the interrelationships among these. The study is grounded in the findings from three case studies that were conducted in the film and visual effects industry. Moreover, we provide initial evidence for the framework&rsquo;s validity beyond this narrow focus. The framework is intended to serve as a sensitizing device that can guide further information systems research on creativity-related phenomena.","['Business process', 'Creativity', 'Process automation', 'Process modeling', 'Process performance measurement', 'Risk management']",,en

However, only little research has yet systematically examined the implications of crossboundary business processes for Business Process Management (BPM). These cross-boundary business processes together with the drivers of collaboration and network management as well as governance form one of the key challenges for today&rsquo;s BPM research. In this study we thus systematically review literature and seek to answer whether BPM research in Information Systems (IS) has yet embraced and explored the concept of collaboration. We find that collaborative BPM is a growing trend in IS research, but that there still exist significant research gaps. Therefore, we propose a research agenda that points at potentially fruitful directions for future research.","['Business process management', 'Collaboration', 'Literature review']",,en

12243225,Reconstructing the Giant: On the Importance of Rigour in Documenting the Literature Search Process,"Science is a cumulative endeavour as new knowledge is often created in the process of interpreting and combining existing knowledge. This is why literature reviews have long played a decisive role in scholarship. The quality of literature reviews is particularly determined by the literature search process. As Sir Isaac Newton eminently put it: &ldquo;If I can see further, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.&rdquo; Drawing on this metaphor, the goal of writing a literature review is to reconstruct the giant of accumulated knowledge in a specific domain. And in doing so, a literature search represents the fundamental first step that makes up the giant&rsquo;s skeleton and largely determines its reconstruction in the subsequent literature analysis. In this paper, we argue that the process of searching the literature must be comprehensibly described. Only then can readers assess the exhaustiveness of the review and other scholars in the field can more confidently (re)use the results in their own research. We set out to explore the methodological rigour of literature review articles published in ten major information systems (IS) journals and show that many of these reviews do not thoroughly document the process of literature search. The results drawn from our analysis lead us to call for more rigour in documenting the literature search process and to present guidelines for crafting a literature review and search in the IS domain.","['IS community', 'IS journals', 'Literature review', 'Literature search', 'Research methodology', 'Rigour']",,en

For this purpose, an interview and document analysis-based multiple case study has been conducted in Germany. The qualitative analysis covers two shared service implementations on the local government level and identifies important preconditions for shared service emergence, namely cost pressure as motive, the existence of key actors promoting the topic and the existence of prior cooperation. Moreover, it is shown that the structure of such previous cooperation determines, if shared services are being organised in a centralised (shared service centre) or decentralised format (shared service network). © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","['E-Government', 'Networks', 'Public Sector Reform', 'Qualitative Study', 'Shared Services']","['Business Process Management, Empirical Study, Public Sector, Quantitative Study']",

On Citizen Involvement in Public Sector BPM,"'Open Innovation' has been heavily discussed for product innovations; however, an information systems (IS) perspective on 'process innovation' has not yet been taken. Analyzing the example of the public sector in Germany, the paper seeks to investigate the factors that hinder and support 'open process innovation', a concept we define as the involvement of citizens in business process management (BPM) activities. With the help of a quantitative study (n=358), six factors are examined for their impact on citizen involvement in local government BPM initiatives. The results show that citizen involvement in reform processes is not primarily motivated by the aim of cost reduction, but rather related to legitimacy reasons and the intent to increase employee motivation. Based on these findings, implications for (design) theory and practice are discussed: Instead of detailed collaborative business processes modeling, the key of citizen involvement in public sector BPM lies in communication and mutual understanding. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","['Business Process Management', 'Empirical Study', 'Public Sector', 'Quantitative Study']",,

12243844,Epistemological Perspectives on Ontology-based Theories for Conceptual Modeling,"Conceptual modeling is a core activity within information systems analysis and design. In response to continuous criticisms targeting the foundation of conceptual modeling, the notion of ontology as a theoretical reference has gained immense popularity over recent decades. At the forefront of these ontology-based theories is the Bunge-Wand-Weber representation model, which has frequently been applied in conceptual modeling research, most notably to the task of evaluating conceptual Information Systems analysis and design models and modeling grammars. Recently, however, ontology-based theories themselves have been subjected to criticisms, in particular in respect to their epistemological presuppositions. In our paper we address the question of epistemology in conceptual modeling research based on ontological theories, and argue that there is an immanent need for publishing the epistemological assumptions of these theories in order to be able to critically evaluate boundaries, scope and limits of these theories for conceptual modeling. We present a discussion framework that facilitates the analysis of epistemological viewpoints and their implications. We apply this framework to the commonly known Bunge-Wand-Weber model and discuss the implications of our findings towards the feasibility of ontology as a reference theory for conceptual modeling. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

Here, we analyse public sector innovations and identify politico-administrative system dynamics shaping the processes of their emergence and diffusion. By means of expert interviews in Japan, we seek to elaborate our argument that system dynamics, such as recent efforts to decentralise and localise governance, have significant impact on how innovations and the diffusion of innovations take place.

12244446,Epistemological Perspectives on Design Science,"Design science is an established approach in IS research and the literature provides us with a fruitful discussion on its basic concepts, for instance, the IS research cycle (Hevner, March, Park and Sudha 2004), IT artifacts (Orlikowski and Iacono 2001; Weber 2003), or design theories (Markus, Majchrzak and Gasser 2002; Walls, Widmeyer and El Sawy 1992). However, many authors advocating the stance of design science often neglect the influence of basic philosophical and epistemological issues on design science. ""The major emphasis of such debates [on positivism and interpretivism] lies in the epistemologies of research, the underlying assumption being that of natural sciences[, not of design science]."" (Hevner et al. 2004, p. 98) Here, design science is often, to our understanding incorrectly, advocated as a third paradigm that adds up to positivism and interpretivism (Hevner et al. 2004; Vaishnavi and Kuechler 2006). However, also design scientists seek to conduct research and to evaluate their research results. At this juncture, we argue that the understanding of such concepts as 'research rigour', 'research validity' and also 'research quality' heavily depends on the underlying epistemological understanding, also in design science! In order to demonstrate and operationalize our argument, we will analyse Hevner et al.'s guidelines for design science in IS research (2004) taking an interpretivist perspective informed by Klein & Myers's set of principles for conducting and evaluating interpretive field studies (1999). As a result, we will epistemologically reformulate the existing design science research guidelines and provide a basic outline for an interpretivist perspective on them.","['Design science', 'Epistemology', 'Philosophy', 'Research evaluation']",,

12244753,"Criticality, Epistemology, and Behaviour vs. Design - Information Systems Research Across Different Sets of Paradigms","Due to its dynamic and rapid development and due to a variety of academic disciplines and research communities contributing to information systems (IS) research, a broad variety of research approaches can be found. These approaches are often discussed as contrasting ""paradigms"". Positivism and interpretivism are frequently accepted to be the most relevant paradigms (cf., for instance, Klein & Myers 1999; Lee 1991; Walsham 1995; Weber 2004). A further set of paradigms consists of behavioural science research ('problem understanding paradigm') and design science research ('problem understanding paradigm') which has been introduced in the IS literature and heavily adopted since (cf., for instance, Hevner et al. 2004; Jani 2001; March & Smith 1995). On top of this distinction, the critical research paradigm, including its logical complement, the non-critical paradigm, shaped the discussion of IS research philosophy for more than two decades (cf., for instance, Brooke 2002; Klein & Huynh 2004; Landry & Banville 1992; Mumford et al. 1985). Though it is essential to research theory and practice in the IS discipline to discuss the interconnections between these different sets of paradigms, such endeavour has not yet been undertaken. Some approaches address the interdependency between interpretivism and critical research. However, a holistic framework, also taking into account also behavioural and design science is still missing. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide an integrated discussion of these different sets of paradigms and to provide novel perspectives for IS research on how to deal with the apparent diversity of approaches. We will furthermore point out why this discussion is of great importance to IS research especially in Europe.","['Behavioural science research', 'Critical research', 'Design science research', 'Epistemology', 'Linguistic interpretivism', 'Methodological pluralism', 'Positivism', 'Research paradigms']","['Balanced scorecard, Conceptual modelling, Enterprise knowledge development, Enterprise modelling, Management information systems']",
12244827,Participative Enterprise Modelling for Balanced Scorecard Implementation,"Balanced Scorecards (BSC) have been established as a valuable and practicable instrument addressing major management problems in organisations. BSC are commonly IT-supported and found a conceptual basis for management information systems. They are often applied to IT-Controlling, and they are also repeatedly applied to specify requirements towards the corporate IT architecture. However, BSC implementation often struggles when it comes to discovering and documenting organisational knowledge that is not easily accessible or not of sufficient quality. On the other hand, Enterprise modelling (EM) seeks to solve organisational design problems in, for instance, business process reengineering, strategy planning, enterprise integration, and information systems development. Here, participative EM methods lead to improved quality as well as to consensus and to increased acceptance of the business decisions. At this juncture, participative EM can support BSC implementation projects that comprise activities requiring the discovery and documentation of organisational knowledge that is not easily accessible or not of sufficient quality. For that reason, the aim of this paper is to integrate participative EM approaches, taking Enterprise Knowledge Development (EKD) as an example, and BSC implementation. In order to operationalise this conceptual improvement, we will perform a stepwise analysis of BSC implementation processes and identify shortcomings that are able to be addressed with the help of participative enterprise modelling.","['Balanced scorecard', 'Conceptual modelling', 'Enterprise knowledge development', 'Enterprise modelling', 'Management information systems']",,

Also, the literature analyzes the epistemological assumptions of research paradigms, but pays little attention to a direct association of research methods with epistemology.

However, only little empirical work has focused on their evaluation so far. This raises the question whether a holistic approach to determining the quality of conceptual models is available yet. In order to describe the current state of research and to expose the so far neglected research fields we develop a two dimensional framework. With the help of this framework we can identify a notable shortcoming on conceptual model evaluation. Contrary to models on theories a lot of empirical work has been performed. Therefore we apply the structuralist approach from philosophy of science in order to develop an inner structure of conceptual models. Based on these findings we deduce the structural requirements that conceptual models shall meet.

Thus, they provide a means to transport and interface knowledge of different parties. Since standards tend to be exhaustive, they commonly provide more than is needed for any given situation.

Increased competition, short innovation cycles, changed usage patterns, increased customer expectations and cost reduction are the main drivers. Our objective is to analyze to what extend transformation projects have improved the orientation towards the end-customers. Therefore, we selected 38 real-life case studies that are dealing with customer orientation. Our analysis is based on a telecommunication-specific framework that aligns strategy, business processes and information systems. The result of our analysis shows the following: Transformation projects that aim to improve the customer orientation are combined with clear goals on costs and revenue of the enterprise. These projects are usually directly linked to the customer touch points, but also to the development and provisioning of products. Furthermore, the analysis shows that customer orientation is not the sole trigger for transformation.

However, current profiles found in information systems offer either unstructured free text that is hard to handle efficiently or simplistic rating schemes that do not convey meaningful information. In addition, it is unclear how trustworthy the information on the profile is. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to online skills profiles based on users' confirmations and the SkillRank credibility ranking and describe its prototype implementation. As spadework, we set forth six basic requirements for online skill evaluations which should generally be reflected in corresponding IS design. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",,,en

This section of the book presents innovative flexible processes for inter-enterprise collaborative planning and execution. These processes support the industry's need for effective and efficient collaboration of planning capacities throughout the supply network. These have been developed to overcome process-related limitations that are prevalent within the automotive industry today. Collaborative planning and execution processes span the whole integrated supply network and are capable of supporting dynamic capacity allocation based on plant-specific constraints. They enhance the capability to adjust capacity to fall within a plant's profitable range. They also take into account the current network context and individual capacity situation in the supply network. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,,

This requires a coordinated approach by all actors involved in disaster or humanitarian relief efforts. Since the logistics part of disaster relief spending is accountable for a major part of disaster relief spending, it is natural to look at the supply chains of humanitarian organizations when searching for potentials for cooperation during humanitarian operations. In this paper, we have reviewed Supply Chain Management software currently used or piloted in humanitarian organizations. Their main features are presented and the tools are assessed according to criteria specific to supply chain management requirements of humanitarian operations. We find that while there is one tool which has the potential of becoming a de-facto standard, there are still gaps to be filled.","['Disasters', 'Humanitarian operations', 'Software', 'State-of-the-art', 'Supply chain management']",,

14031837,Leveraging Test Case Generation in the Testing Process – An Integration of Human Oracles with Derived Oracles,"In the testing process humans examine the behavior of an application under test to determine what would constitute a failure. By specifying&mdash;for a given input and result&mdash;whether or not this combination leads to desired behavior, they essentially constitute to what is called the test oracle. To automate oracle generation, techniques were introduced to derive the oracle from models, specification, or by reusing artifacts. In the end, to complete the oracle, a human must be involved. Automated Test Case Generation (ATCG) on the other hand, already derives all feasible test cases from the program itself - baring judgment about which cases correspond to faults. This paper introduces a tool that derives the oracle by using ATCG as input for a human oracle. By combining ATCG with human oracles, we aim to reduce costs associated with the testing process.","['Database applications ingertation with automated unit tests generation', 'Java enterprise edition', 'Java persistence API', 'Test oracles']",,en

14055159,Towards Standardized and Seamless Integration of Expert Knowledge into Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms,"Evolutionary algorithms allow for solving a wide range of multi-objective optimization problems. Nevertheless for complex practical problems, including domain knowledge is imperative to achieve good results. In many domains, single-objective expert knowledge is available, but its integration into modern multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is often not trivial and infeasible for practitioners. In addition to the need of modifying algorithm architectures, the challenge of combining single-objective knowledge to multi-objective rules arises. This contribution takes a step towards a multi-objective optimization framework with defined interfaces for expert knowledge integration. Therefore, multi-objective mutation and local search operators are integrated into the two MOEAs MOEA/D and R-NSGAII. Results from experiments on exemplary machine scheduling problems prove the potential of such a concept and motivate further research in this direction.","['Expert knowledge integration', 'MOEA/D', 'Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm', 'R-NSGAII', 'Scheduling']","['Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), IT service management (ITSM), IT service specification, ITility service']",en
14059192,Developing a Common Understanding of IT Services – The Case of a German University,"IT service management is the prevailing standard for IT operations in practice. It is rooted in the so-called Information Technology Infrastructure Library, a best practice standard that proposes to look upon IT functions as a service provider that delivers IT services to the business. This idea of a service orientation has also attracted academic attention since the turn of the century. Although, the core concept of ITSM, the IT service itself, is still not clearly defined, and thus practitioners still struggle with this concept. Therefore, based on the ITIL and the academic literature, we developed an IT service definition that contains six unique characteristics. This definition has been tested in a case study that we conducted with the IT department of a German university. In this paper, we elaborate on the empirical validation and its results.","['Case study research', 'Evaluation research', 'IT service', 'IT service management', 'ITIL']","['Adaptive normalized niche radius, CEC2013 test suite, Mahalanobis distance metric, Niching, Robust mean peak ratio']",en
14059361,Giving IT Services a Theoretical Backing,"The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is the prevailing standard for managing Information Technology (IT) operations in practice. What is revolutionary about the ITIL is that it proposes to conceive of IT not (only) as a technology, but rather as a means of providing services to businesses. This idea has gained considerable attention in academia, and has given rise to identifying “IT Service Management (ITSM)” as a new management paradigm and field of research. Unfortunately, the concept of an IT service has been poorly elaborated the within ITIL, and remains elusive in the academic debate surrounding ITSM. With this paper, we set out to resolve the vagueness surrounding the notion of an IT service based on an extensive literature review. We conclude a set of six defining features that we believe, if taken together, fully capture the concept of an IT service. We also substantiate these features with underlying theories. Finally, we illustrate the potential of our definition with an exemplary IT service that we defined for a German publishing company in the context of an ITSM research project we recently conducted.","['Information technology infrastructure library (ITIL)', 'IT service management (ITSM)', 'IT service specification', 'ITility service']",,en
14062997,Multimodal Optimization by Covariance Matrix Self-Adaptation Evolution Strategy with Repelling Subpopulations,"During the recent decades, many niching methods have been proposed and empirically verified on some available test problems. They often rely on some particular assumptions associated with the distribution, shape, and size of the basins, which can seldom be made in practical optimization problems. This study utilizes several existing concepts and techniques, such as taboo points, normalized Mahalanobis distance, and the Ursem’s hill-valley function in order to develop a new tool for multimodal optimization, which does not make any of these assumptions. In the proposed method, several subpopulations explore the search space in parallel. Offspring of a subpopulation are forced to maintain a sufficient distance to the center of fitter subpopulations and the previously identified basins, which are marked as taboo points. The taboo points repel the subpopulation to prevent convergence to the same basin. A strategy to update the repelling power of the taboo points is proposed to address the challenge of basins of dissimilar size. The local shape of a basin is also approximated by the distribution of the subpopulation members converging to that basin. The proposed niching strategy is incorporated into the covariance matrix self-adaptation evolution strategy (CMSA-ES), a potent global optimization method. The resultant method, called the covariance matrix self-adaptation with repelling subpopulations (RS-CMSA), is assessed and compared to several state-of-the-art niching methods on a standard test suite for multimodal optimization. An organized procedure for parameter setting is followed which assumes a rough estimation of the desired/expected number of minima available. Performance sensitivity to the accuracy of this estimation is also studied by introducing the concept of robust mean peak ratio. Based on the numerical results using the available and the introduced performance measures, RS-CMSA emerges as the most successful method when robustness and efficiency are considered at the same time.","['Adaptive normalized niche radius', 'CEC2013 test suite', 'Mahalanobis distance metric', 'Niching', 'Robust mean peak ratio']",,en

While looking for career information and guidance, young women consult family and friends but also the internet. Although there is already a plethora of career information websites, those are seldom tailored to the interests of young women. To address the IT-gender gap with the design of a platform that appeals to the needs of the target group, we firstly analyzed existing German websites for career information and guidance. The analysis was framed by literature on women’s IT career choice barriers. Secondly, we evaluated selected websites with focus groups of female students. Finally, we present design recommendations to enhance web-based career information and guidance platforms for young women to raise their interest in IT-related careers.",,,en

Defenders can gain advantage in this race by sharing cyber risk information with each other.

A growing line of research studies these strategic aspects that drive defenders&rsquo; sharing decisions. The present survey systematizes these works in a novel framework.

14080643,Economics of Ransomware Attacks,"Over the last few years, both the development of ransomware strains as well as changes in the marketplace for malware have allowed attackers to conduct large-scale ransomware attacks. The increased prevalence of these attacks have led government entities and software vendors to advise victims on how best to respond if hit by ransomware. In this paper, we examine how this new mode of attack impacts consumer behavior in order to understand how it indirectly affects software vendors. We demonstrate that when victims face a decision of whether to pay ransom, the vendor&rsquo;s incentives are fundamentally altered. In particular, we show that both the equilibrium market size and the vendor&rsquo;s profit under optimal pricing can actually increase in the ransom demand. Furthermore, recent attacks have called into question what motives these attackers may have: are they purely profit-motivated or are they instead politically-motivated attackers who care more about causing as much damage as possible? We find that ransomware enables attackers to achieve both goals simultaneously.",,"['Content generation, Data management, Supply chain visualization']",en

For achieving high supply chain performance, it is also necessary that the information provided by IMS is integrated into the operational planning of the spare parts supply chain. Thus, this paper proposes a procedure for the integration of the spare parts supply chain operational decision level and the IMS.

The use of the notion of materiality causes a conflation of different ontological claims, and a conceptual clarification is needed to grasp the polysemy of materiality. This paper provides some key notions for those interested in addressing the materiality of the affective register at work.

With more than 70% of citizens using the internet to retrieve information, websites become a crucial touchpoint for the public's interaction with administrations. The design and quality of these websites and services offered through them may have a considerable impact on the user's willingness to further engage with public administrations online. This article sets out to evaluate the German state capitals' websites with regard to their e-government maturity. We use a maturity evaluation scheme that considers five aspects of e-government: information, communication, transaction, integration, and participation. The results indicate that there is a substantial variety in the websites' maturity, horizontally as well as vertically. All cities perform well in furnishing information and make use of various communication channels.

Path analyses are given, demonstrating the importance of visualisation to understand and interpret online journey patterns. Results are interpreted from a social psychology point of view, explaining and contributing by using the cognitive dissonance theory in an online search context. The conclusion is that online behaviour within a single brand is complex, yielding important analytical and managerial insights that are based on the aggregated behaviour of customers.

We find evidence that the resilience of the IOIS over this long time period is explained by a layered accumulation of new structures at the level of individual practices, while the punctuated evolutionary change accompanied the appearance of a new practice, historically connected to the incumbent practices. These findings are in substantial agreement with systems evolution mechanisms proposed by Porra (1999).

16474620,A Framework for the Development of Multi-Agent Systems in Supply Chain Management,"The application of multi-agent systems in the context of supply chain management has been much discussed during the last years and several implementations have emerged within research. Yet very few applications are actually being used in practice. The reason for this lies in an existing gap between domain concepts and agent technology, which complicates the application oriented development. A framework can support this process in order to devise customized and flexible solutions by providing the necessary agent modules and a supply chain management specific ontology. Within this paper, an analysis of requirements on multi-agent systems that stem from the domain of supply chain management is carried out. This forms the basis for the development of the architecture of the multi-agent framework whose design and implementation is described. In the following, common modules are designed and implemented to provide both a sophisticated and generic basis for specific projects. © 2009 IEEE.",,,en

For categorical data there are no ""standard indices"" formalizing the first aspect. Instead, a number of ad hoc concepts have been used in cluster analysis, labelled ""similarity"", "" information"", ""impurity"" and the like. To clarify matters, we start out from a set of axioms summarizing our conception of ""dispersion"" for categorical attributes. To no surprise, it turns out, that some well-known measures, including the Gini index and the entropy, qualify as measures of dispersion. We try to indicate, how these measures can be used in unsupervised classification problems as well. Due to its simple analytic form, the Gini index allows for a dispersion-decomposition formula that can be made the starting point for a CART-like cluster tree. Trees are favoured because of i) factor selection and ii) communicability.",,"['Booty trees, Factor reduction, Ordinal measure of dispersion, Predictive measure of association']",en

CHAID, in contrast, admits multiple splittings, a feature that allows to exploit the splitting variable more extensively. On the other hand, that procedure depends on premises that are questionable in practical applications. This can be put down to the fact that CHAID relies on simultaneous Chi-Square-resp. F-tests. The null-distribution of the second test statistic, for instance, relies on the normality assumption that is not plausible in a data mining context. Moreover, none of these procedures - as implemented in SPSS, for instance - take ordinal dependent variables into account. In the paper we suggest an alternative tree-algorithm that: • Requires explanatory categorical variables • Chooses splitting attributes by means of predictive measures of association. The cells to be united - respectively the number of splits - are determined with the help of their conditional predictive power • Greedily searches for a part of the population that can be classified/scored rather precisely • Takes ordinal dependent variables into consideration © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","['Booty trees', 'Factor reduction', 'Ordinal measure of dispersion', 'Predictive measure of association']","['Fraud detection', ' Last digits', ' Digit analysis', ' Benford’s law']",en

16476535,The Value of the Last Digit. Statistical Fraud Detection with Digit Analysis,"Digit distributions are a popular tool for the detection of tax payers' noncompliance and other fraud. In the early stage of digital analysis, Nigrini and Mittermaier (A J Pract Theory 16(2):52-67, 1997) made use of Benford's Law (Benford in Am Philos Soc 78:551-572, 1938) as a natural reference distribution. A justification of that hypothesis is only known for multiplicative sequences (Schatte in J Inf Process Cyber EIK 24:443-455, 1988). In applications, most of the number generating processes are of an additive nature and no single choice of &lsquo;an universal first-digit law' seems to be plausible (Scott and Fasli in Benford's law: an empirical investigation and a novel explanation. CSM Technical Report 349, Department of Computer Science, University of Essex,http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/technical-reports/2001/CSM-349.pdf, 2001). In that situation, some practioneers (e.g. financial authorities) take recourse to a last digit analysis based on the hypothesis of a Laplace distribution. We prove that last digits are approximately uniform for distributions with an absolutely continuous distribution function. From a practical perspective, that result, of course, is only moderately interesting. For that reason, we derive a result for &lsquo;certain' sums of lattice-variables as well. That justification is provided in terms of stationary distributions.",Fraud detection; Last digits; Digit analysis; Benford’s law,,en

The chapter summarizes the central functionality of a database system both from a users' and from a systems' point of view, and discusses relational databases primarily as seen by a user, in particular the language of the relational model, design issues, query languages, important facets of relational database theory, and implications of giving up one of the most basic assumptions in this model (first normal form). The practical need for efficient organization, creation, manipulation and maintenance of large collections of information, together with the recognition that data about the real world, which is manipulated by application programs, should be treated as an integrated resource independently of these programs, has led to the development of database management.

16994262,Securing the Infrastructure for Service-Based E-Learning Environments,"E-learning environments and their system functionalities resemble one another to a large extent. Recent standardization efforts in e-learning concentrate on the reuse of learning material only, but not on the reuse of application or system functionalities. The LearnServe system, under development at the University of Muenster, builds on the assumption that a typical learning system is a collection of activities or processes that interact with learners and suitably chosen content, the latter in the form of learning objects. This enables us to divide the main functionality of an e-learning system into a number of stand-alone applications or services. The realization of these applications based on the emerging technical paradigm of Web services then renders a wide reuse of functionality possible, thereby giving learners a higher flexibility of choosing content and functionalities to be included in their learning environment. In such a scenario, it must be possible to maintain user identity and data across service and server boundaries. This chapter presents an architecture for implementing user authentication and the manipulation of user data across several Web services. In particular, it demonstrates how to exploit the SPML and SAML standards so that cross-domain single sign-on can be offered to the users of a service-based learning environment.

16996097,Reflective Programming in the Relational Algebra,"This paper introduces a reflective extension of the relational algebra. Reflection is achieved by storing and manipulating relational algebra programs as relations and by adding a LISP-like evaluation operation to the algebra. We first show that this extension, which we call the reflective algebra, can serve as a unifying formalization of various forms of procedural data management which have been considered in database systems research. We then study the expressive power and complexity of the reflective algebra. In particular, we establish a close correspondence between reflection and bounded looping, and between tail-recursive reflection and unbounded looping. These correspondences yield new logical characterizations of PTIME and PSPACE. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,,en
16996176,Towards Class-less Object Models for Engineering Design Applications,"Engineering design applications have specific requirements to database support not yet completely met by existing systems. We argue that one reason is the inability of current object models to capture the needs of design applications appropriately. We show how to combine concepts from prototype programming languages with a versioning mechanism for objects into a new model which does without the notion of a class. The idea is that objects can freely exist in a database, have multiple versions, and can share structure and behavior with others. In addition, working with design objects is done both associatively (via user-defined identifiers) and declaratively (via collections as a query tool).",,,en
16996258,An Extension of Path Expressions to Simplify Navigation in Object-Oriented Queries,"Path expressions, a central ingredient of query languages for objectoriented databases, are currently used as a purely navigational vehicle. We argue that this does not fully exploit their potential expressive power as a tool to specify connections between objects. In particular, a user should not be required to specify a path to be followed in full, but rather should provide enough information so that the system can infer missing details automatically. We present and study an extended mechanism for path expressions which resembles the omission of joins in universal relation interfaces. The semantics of our mechanism is given in the general framework of a calculus-like query language. Techniques from semantic query optimization are employed to obtain efficient specifications. We also consider the possibility that links can be traversed backwards, which subsumes previous proposals to specify inverse relationships at the schema level and also fully exploits the meaning of inheritance links.",,,en

16996724,Transforming Relational Database Schemas into Object-Oriented Schemas according to ODMG-93,"Many database applications are currently confronted with the problem of migrating from relational to object-oriented systems. A central task in such a process is schema conversion, which so far has to be done in a way that specifically depends on the target system. Recently, the ODMG-93 proposal has established a framework in which the core aspects of an object-oriented schema can be made precise, so that it becomes possible to do schema conversions in a system-independent way, by using the ODMG model as target. This paper presents a methodology for transforming relational schemas into object-oriented ones according to ODMG-93, thereby rendering it possible to do reverse engineering computer-assisted, and to automate database migrations. Essentially, the methodology is a three-step process who first goal is to complete a given relational schema, i.e., to make the semantic information it carries as explicit as possible using a variety of data dependencies. A completed schema is then transformed into an ODMG schema in a straightforward way, basically by generating classes from relation schemas. However, the result will in general not yet be optimal from an object-oriented perspective; so the initial object-oriented schema is finally improved to better exploit the options available in the object-oriented paradigm.",,,en

CORBA defines client/server middleware in which objects are uniformly used for letting existing applications discover each other, interoperate, and interact with each other. Through a variety of predefined object services, CORBA additionally allows to create and delete objects, access them by name, make them transactional or secure, and store them persistently in a vastly arbitrary external storage system. In this paper, the core components of CORBA, which are collectively called the Object Management Architecture, are described in some detail. It is indicated how CORBA can be employed for developing distributed information systems.",,,en

16997912,Design and Implementation of a Novel Approach to Keyword Searching in Relational Databases,"The majority of the tools available for browsing and searching the Web is based on extracting information from structured documents. However, as information on the Web increasingly comes out of a database, it is crucial to be able to search databases when working with the Web. Due to the highly dynamic nature of the Web, it is unlikely ever to know the underlying schemata of those databases. We remedy this situation by introducing an extension of SQL called Reflective SQL (RSQL) which treats data and queries uniformly. Queries are stored in specific program relations and can be evaluated by a LISP-like operator called eval. Program relations cannot only be constructed for given queries, but their contents can also be generated dynamically based on the current contents of the underlying database. RSQL serves as a basis for a keyword-based search which renders it possible to formulate queries to databases in the absence of schema-knowledge. It is shown how this language can be exploited as a Web search engine that works on databases instead of documents.",,['View complement'],en

This paper introduces a novel query language which renders it possible to formulate queries to databases in the absence of schema-knowledge. The proposed language Schema-Independent SQL (SISQL) takes parameterized SQL queries as input and dynamically generates correct SQL statements for collections of underlying schemata. SISQL is based on the Reflective Relational Algebra as a `processing engine,' which has been proposed in recent years for overcoming the limitations of classical algebra with respect to the treatment of procedural data.",,,en
16998072,On the Computation of Relational View Complements,"Views as a means to describe parts of a given data collection play an important role in many database applications. In dynamic environments, where data is updated, not only information provided by views, but also information provided by data sources but missing from views turns out to be relevant: Previously, this missing information was characterized in terms of view complements; recently, it was shown that view complements can be exploited in the context of data warehouses to guarantee desirable warehouse properties such as independence and self-maintainability. As the complete source information is a trivial complement for any given view, a natural interest for ""small"" or even ""minimal"" complements arises. However, the computation of minimal complements is still not too well understood. In this paper, we show how to compute reasonably small (and in special cases even minimal) complements for monotonic relational views, where the complexity of constructing complements is polynomial in the size of schema information.",['View complement'],"['Data analysis, Data engineering, Data warehouses, Databases, Investments']",en

In this context analyses focus on data that has been gathered over long periods of time, often between one and five years. A data warehouse can therefore be regarded as a specialized historical database. However not only the data kept in a data warehouse has to be seen in a temporal context, but also the fact that dimension data may undergo changes during such a time period needs to be taken into consideration. In this paper we focus on update operations on dimensions and establish a notion of consistency for guiding such operations. We devise algorithms for executing update operations that can be shown to preserve consistency, and we study their time complexity.","['Data analysis', 'Data engineering', 'Data warehouses', 'Databases', 'Investments']",,en

16998468,E-Learning as a Web Service (Extended Abstract),"E-learning has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. It is often perceived as a group effort, where content authors, instructional designers, multimedia technicians, teachers, trainers, database administrators, and people from various other areas of expertise come together in order to serve a community of learners. In a typical e-learning scenario, many of the activities can be perceived and modeled as processes and consequently be executed as workflows; there are even prototypical system developments that are experimenting with this approach. On the other hand, there are increasingly many activities, which aim at providing services of any kind on the Web; these can occur as business-to-business or as business-to-consumer services and are generally subsumed under the term Web services. In this paper we suggest to combine the areas of e-learning and Web services, by providing electronic learning offerings as (individual or collections of) Web services as well. We elaborate on this by showing how content providers and content consumers (i.e., learners) can communicate appropriately through a Web service platform with its common description, publication, and retrieval functionalities. Finally, we indicate how a corresponding system can be realized. © 2003 IEEE.",,,en
16998548,Learning Objects as a Uniform Foundation for E-Learning Platforms,"Learning objects are under discussion in the context of electronic and in particular Web-based learning. Intuitively, they represent reusable units of learning content that can be consumed or studied within a single learning session, and that can be sequenced into larger units such as classes and courses if necessary or desired. To achieve these goals, making learning objects amenable to the technical support of a database system appears appropriate. Once this view is in place, learning objects can be used as the central and uniform foundation of an e-learning platform that, for example, is capable of tracking users or of adapting content to users, and that can simultaneously handle a company's knowledge management. It is shown in this paper how the latter can be achieved through a common exploitation of (and interaction between) database objects and suitably designed processes. © 2003 IEEE.",,,en

A repository for learning object publication and search is proposed that essentially adapts the UDDI framework used in commercial Web services to the e-learning context.

However, while industry standards for the description, composition, and orchestration of Web services have been under discussion (and development) for quite some time already, their conceptual underpinnings are still in their infancy. Indeed, conceptual models for service specification are rare so far, as are investigations based on them. This paper presents a multi-level service composition model that perceives service specification as going through several levels of abstraction, from transactional operations to the end user. Importantly, the model allows for specification of desirable composition properties at all levels. Different ways of achieving these properties as well as implications of the model are addressed.",,,en
16999342,Schema Versioning in Data Warehouses,"As several mature implementations of data warehousing systems are fully operational, a crucial role in preserving their up-to-dateness is played by the ability to manage the changes that the data warehouse (DW) schema undergoes over time in response to evolving business requirements. In this paper we propose an approach to schema versioning in DWs, where the designer may decide to undertake some actions on old data aimed at increasing the flexibility in formulating cross-version queries, i.e., queries spanning multiple schema versions. After introducing an algebra of DW schema operations, we define a history of versions for data warehouse schemata and discuss the relationship between the temporal horizon spanned by a query and the schema on which it can consistently be formulated. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,,en

16999659,Mediators for Integrating Content into Service-based e-Learning Environments,"The provision of e-learning content through the emerging paradigm of Web services leads to a number of advantages over traditional, centralized e-learning platforms which store learning objects in their own database. This is on the one hand the timeliness of content since it is stored on remote machines and called on demand only. Decentralized storage makes content improvements readily available for all learners. On the other hand, content is now available for a larger group of users since it is no longer stored in closed platforms. However, the composition of content into courses needs new strategies, as content cannot simply be copied and assembled to Packaging Interchange Files (PIF) as specified by IMS and SCORM. In this paper we show different ways how a mediator can offer courses that are based on the Web services paradigm. In particular, we describe how a repository in a distributed architecture can be enhanced to provide added value for learners, by offering courses built from content services that are available on the Web. © 2005 IEEE.","['E-Learning', 'Learning Objects', 'Web Services']","['Automatic pre-correction, Blended learning, e-learning, Programming exercises']",en

16999815,Efficient Handling of Programming Exercises in a Scalable E-Learning Platform,"e-Learning has become a major field of interest in recent years, and multiple approaches and solutions have been developed. A typical form of e-learning applications comprises exercise submission and assessment systems that allow students to work on assignments whenever and where they want (i.e., dislocated, asynchronous work). In basic computer science courses, programming exercises are widely used and courses have a very large number of participants. However, there is still no efficient way for supporting tutors to correct these exercises, as experience has shown that correction (and, beyond that, automatic grading) are difficult. In this paper we present an enhancement of the xLx platform developed at the University of Muenster to efficiently support tutors in handling Java programming exercises electronically. The new component is based on concepts of automatic static and dynamic testing approaches, well known from software engineering, and provides an automatic pre-correction of submitted solutions. In addition, a tutor is able to annotate solutions manually, by adding comments that are associated with the source code of the solution in an intelligent way. Static tests are based on a compilation of the sources to find syntactical errors, while dynamic tests use test cases defined by tutors during the creation of the exercises and have to be executed correctly on the solutions in order to receive credits for the exercises.","['Automatic pre-correction', 'Blended learning', 'e-learning', 'Programming exercises']",,en

However, the design and specification of an ontology still does not follow a generally accepted methodology, but is considered to be a task based on perception and intuition. This paper tries to remedy this situation by proposing a novel methodology for ontology engineering that is based on the phase model of traditional database design. Accordingly, the design process of an ontology consists of (1) requirements analysis, (2) conceptual design, (3) logical design, and (4) physical design. Detailed design guidelines are given which include continuous evaluation at the end of each phase.

It is argued here that a combined bottom-up/top-down strategy is needed for properly developing SOAs, in which business goals and processes are taken into account right from the beginning.

Although service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are well-understood in the field of software engineering, the e-Learning community has started only recently to discuss SOAs for e-Learning. This paper takes a closer look at the implications of service orientation on SCORM, because this new type of e-Learning platform architecture offers a different way of reusing content and functionalities. SCORM is widely accepted by e-Learning manufacturers to establish a distributed learning environment model that fosters the interoperability of learning tools and course content. It is near at hand to use the SCORM approach also for service-oriented e-Learning environments. However, as is shown in this paper, several improvements have to be executed to specify a SCORM version for a SOA. © 2006 IEEE.",,,en

Based on metadata standards such as LOM (Learning Object Metadata), e-Learning repositories can offer an effective and efficient search for e-Learning content. The emerging paradigm of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) enables developers to implement open systems instead of monolithic ones. Well-defined interfaces for distributed systems have to be provided to enable easy integration of functionalities. In this context it is important to build the entire system architecture on a suitably chosen metadata standard. The e-Learning Repository share.loc presented in this paper uses special implementations of LOM within its different tiers of the entire architecture. An additional service tier that is implemented vertically to the common application tiers enables remote systems to request LOM-compliant representations of metadata from each tier that are tailored towards their individual needs. © 2006 IEEE.",,,en

These objectives are actually achieved in LOM only to a limited degree, despite the designation as de-facto standard for description of electronic learning content: Based on the complexity of the standard, a high the oretical potential faces rejection inpractice. One reason for this is that the process of metadata generation (e.g.., who creates which metadata attributes) is not defined in detail yet. This article illustrates an approach that guarantees a high quantity as well as a high quality of learning object metadata records, bringing together known ways of metadata creation and the new paradigm of users describing content as implemented in recent Web 2. 0 applications.

Particularly the Web has promoted the concept of ""clickable "" links to users. Typically, hyperlinks are only used to interact with applications and content in the ""virtual"" sphere of information systems. However, the basic idea of a hyperlink, which is creating an inviolable link between two resources, can be extended to the physical world as well and then allows a much closer and more intuitive interaction with information systems in many scenarios. We describe how RFID tags can be used to implement physical hyperlinks that establish a direct connection between a physical object and a mobile information system. Any kind of mobile, object-centered information system, such as the PDA-based visitor information system for museums MoVIS presented in this paper, provides a richer experience for users when it is extended into the physical world with physical hyperlinks. © 2007 IEEE.",,,en

However, the concept of intensive learning, for example immediately prior to an exam, is only supported to a minor degree, if at all; thus, a recapitulation of learning content often still takes place in a traditional way where digital content is printed on paper and then annotated with highlighters and post-its, for example. The Learnr Web platform under development at the University of Münster bridges this gap within the process of technology enhanced learning by adopting well-known learning paradigms to the digital world. Following a community-driven, Web 2.0-coined approach, on the one side structures representing the learners' language, collaboratively created summaries and file cards arise; at a social level bottom-up networking and learning communities are fostered through sharing of individually created material.","['Collaborative e-learning', 'Learning communities', 'Social software', 'Web 2.0']",,en

Another field for applying RFID technology offering a huge set of novel possibilities and applications are mobile applications, where readers are no longer fixed. In order to address the specific issues of mobile RFID-enabled applications and to support developers in rapid application development, we present the architecture of an RFID middleware for mobile applications.

17001479,A Design and Development Methodology for Mobile RFID Applications based on the ID-Services Middleware Architecture,"Mobile RFID-enhanced applications (""Mobile RFID"") offer a unique way of interacting with the physical world by using the touch paradigm. They offer an intuitive way to interact with physical objects to which RFID transponders are attached. However, the development of mobile RFID applications is not well supported yet, in contrast to stationary RFID applications where typically RFID middleware components are used to integrate RFID technology into information systems. Our ID-Services RFID middleware architecture applies the idea of a dedicated RFID middleware component to mobile information systems and addresses their different requirements with a flexible integration approach based on graduated abstraction and complexity hiding. A major feature of ID-Services is the use of ""proxy objects"" which allow a transparent interaction with objects from the physical world in the same way as with objects from an objectoriented programming paradigm. We propose a design and development methodology for the use of ID-Services that helps speeding up the development process of mobile RFID applications and keeps both design and implementation phases simple, by fully externalizing the complex, RFID-specific concepts and technical details to the ID-Services middleware. © 2009 IEEE.",,,en

17001636,Governance in Web-Oriented Architectures,"Web-oriented Architectures provide a way of designing an IT system by using a variety of Web Procedures, i.e., procedures (or services) called over the Web. The idea of (typically atomic) components that are black boxes, have interfaces, and can be assembled into a larger process is fundamental and has existed since the early days of distributed systems. Two particular types of modern distributed systems are Service-oriented Architectures and Resource-oriented Architectures, which are built upon specific technology stacks and define their own concepts. Weboriented Architecture (WOA) is using the best of both worlds plus some specifics such as Web APIs, in order to build an interconnected IT system in the easiest way possible. In this paper we first sharpen our understanding of the concept behind aWOA, the topology of a WOA and possible integration scenarios within an enterprise. More importantly, we point out how governance and control of a WOA can be achieved, by using a controlling software element called the Web Architecture Controller (WAC) which specifies the Web-centric core elements of a WOA. ©2009 IEEE.",,,en

17002036,Update and Retrieval in a Relational Database through a Universal Schema Interface,"A database system that is based on the universal relation (UR) model aims at freeing its users from specifying access paths on both the physical and on the logical levels. All information about the logical structure of the database (i.e., its conceptual scheme) is hidden from users; they need only to know the attribute names, which now carry all the semantics of the database. Previous work on UR interfaces has concentrated on the design and implementation of query languages that serve to facilitate retrieval of data from a relational database. On the other hand, updates are always handled as before, which means that users still have to know the logical structure of the database in case they want to insert, delete, or modify tuples. In this paper the concepts underlying a UR interface, which is really “universal,” are presented; it is based on the UR model, and it permits not only queries but also updates: Combinations of attributes that may participate in an update-operation (“objects”) have to be specified during the design phase of the database, and are then embodied into the database scheme by an extended synthesis algorithm. They form the basis for any insertion or deletion operation. A precise definition of “insertable” tuples, and of the insert- and delete-operation in this new context, is given. It is then shown that these operations modify a database state in such a way that a representative instance always exists. This is accomplished by providing a more detailed version of Sagiv’s uniqueness condition and by exploring the structure of nonunique objects. Since the underlying database always has a representative instance, this instance can be used to define the window function for retrieval. It is shown that it is still possible to compute windows by a union of minimal extension joins. © 1988, ACM.

17002354,A Formal Framework for Independence with respect to Transactions in the Universal Relation Model,"The notion of independence of a relational database scheme in the context of the universal relational model is investigated. A new, formal definition of independence in terms of database transactions is given that tries to reflect the dynamic behaviour of a database under the assumptions of this model. Known results are restated in this new framework, and two approaches for coping with ""dependent"" schemes are described. First, a precise statement of how such schemes can be handled is given in terms of schema regions, and a tableau-based method is presented for computing these regions. Second, independence is relativized by taking transaction semantics into account. It is shown that any database scheme can be handled by a database system in a way that is similar to independent ones if this semantics is chosen appropriately. © 1991.",,,en

17002671,Static and Dynamic Aspects of Goal-Oriented Concurrency Control,"A new correctness criterion for schedules of update transactions is proposed, which captures users' intended changes to the database. This is motivated by the observation that traditional serializability may lead to anomalies by not taking into account semantics related to such intended changes. The alternate criterion -goal-correctness - is orthogonal to serializability, and is based on realizing goals associated with each transaction. The problems involved in goal-oriented concurrency control are first identified in a general framework. The analysis suggests that this approach is practical only for restricted transaction languages where goals can be inferred and manipulated efficiently. One such language is then considered, capturing a class of updates of practical interest. For this language, it is shown that goal-oriented concurrency control is tractable and compares favorably to serializability with respect to complexity: testing goal-correctness takes polynomial time, while testing serializability is NP-complete. The set of schedules which are correct with respect to the two criteria are incomparable. Thus, goal-correctness may allow increased concurrency. The results highlight the feasibility and advantages of goal-oriented concurrency control in restricted frameworks. The paper also discusses the dynamic aspects of goal-oriented concurrency control; in particular, an optimistic approach to the dynamic generation of goal-correct schedules is presented. © 1993 J.C.

17002750,Multiversion Object Constellations: A New Approach to Support a Designer's Database Work,"The logical organization of database support for CAD applications is considered, which has to account for specific requirements including versioning, consistency and design transactions. A new approach to the organization, manipulation and management of design objects in a design database is described, which is based on the notion of an object constellation. A constellation is a set of multiversion objects together with all their subobjects. Constellations can be versioned into configurations, which comprise one version of each object of the underlying constellation. We argue that constellations are adequate units of allocation to individual designers, while configurations form appropriate units of consistency. We show how the constellation approach renders a flexible support of hierarchically organized, cooperative design processes possible, by employing specific transactions whose scope is limited to well-defined portions of a database. Most importantly, the approach provides new insight into the consistency problem for design databases, by providing an adequate approach to multilevel consistency, and by making consistency of a design context-dependent. © 1994 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","['CAD databases', 'Cooperation', 'Design transactions', 'Versioning']","['Conceptual database design, Entity-Relationship modeling, Reverse engineering, Schema transformations']",en

Since the model was introduced in the mid-seventies, a large body of literature has been published on transforming conceptual ER schemas or diagrams into logical data models. The purpose of this paper is to survey this literature. A first focus is on transformation approaches from the ER model to traditional data models, i.e. to the relational, the network, or the hierarchical model; this is then complemented by a discussion of more recent transformations to object-oriented models. A second focus is on considering the process of reverse engineering, i.e. transformations from a logical model back into the ER model; finally, an overview of direct transformations between various logical data models is presented. © 1995.","['Conceptual database design', 'Entity-Relationship modeling', 'Reverse engineering', 'Schema transformations']",,en

We then study the expressive power and complexity of the reflective algebra. In particular, we establish a close correspondence between reflection and bounded looping, and between tail-recursive reflection and unbounded looping. These correspondences yield new logical characterizations of PTIME and PSPACE. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",,,en

Invariants are used to express constraints which have to be preserved by database transactions. However, a distinction is made between local invariants respected by individual transactions, and global ones maintained by entire schedules. The ideal situation is that a serializable schedule, which preserves local constraints via its equivalence to a serial schedule, also respects the global constraints. For some sample scenarios, we exhibit sufficient conditions under which this is the case. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","['Database transactions', 'Databases', 'I-serializability', 'Serializability']","['Data warehouse, Independence, Materialized view, Self-maintainability, View complement']",en

In this paper, we extend the concept of self-maintainability to (query and update) independence within a formal framework, where independence with respect to arbitrary given sets of queries and updates over the sources can be guaranteed. To this end we establish an intuitively appealing connection between warehouse independence and view complements. Moreover, we study special kinds of complements, namely monotonic complements, and show how to compute minimal ones in the presence of keys and foreign keys in the underlying databases. Taking advantage of these complements, an algorithmic approach is proposed for the specification of independent warehouses with respect to given sets of queries and updates.","['Data warehouse', 'Independence', 'Materialized view', 'Self-maintainability', 'View complement']","['Data warehouse design, Functional dependency, Multidimensional data, Normal form, Summarizability']",en
17003463,Aggregate Queries over Conditional Tables,"Conditional tables have been identified long ago as a way to capture unknown or incomplete information. However, queries over conditional tables have never been allowed to involve column functions such as aggregates. In this paper, the theory of conditional tables is extended in this direction, and it is shown that a strong representation system exists which has the closure property that the result of an aggregate query over a conditional table can be again represented by a conditional table. It turns out, however, that the number of tuples in a conditional table representing the result of an aggregate query may grow exponentially in the number of variables in the table. This phenomenon is analyzed in detail, and tight upper and lower bounds concerning the number of tuples contained in the result of an aggregate query are given. Finally, representation techniques are sketched that approximate aggregation results in tables of reasonable size.","['Aggregate query', 'Data warehouse', 'Database', 'Incomplete information']",,en

In this paper, a sequence of multidimensional normal forms is established that allow reasoning about the quality of conceptual data warehouse schemata in a rigorous manner. These normal forms address traditional database design objectives such as faithfulness, completeness, and freedom of redundancies as well as the notion of summarizability, which is specific to multidimensional database schemata.","['Data warehouse design', 'Functional dependency', 'Multidimensional data', 'Normal form', 'Summarizability']",,en

In this paper we propose an approach to schema versioning in DWs, where the designer may decide to undertake some actions on old data aimed at increasing the flexibility in formulating cross-version queries, i.e., queries spanning multiple schema versions. First, we introduce a representation of DW schemata as graphs of simple functional dependencies, and discuss its properties. Then, after defining an algebra of schema graph modification operations aimed at creating new schema versions, we discuss how augmented schemata can be introduced to increase flexibility in cross-version querying. Next, we show how a history of versions for DW schemata is managed and discuss the relationship between the temporal horizon spanned by a query and the schema on which it can consistently be formulated. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

17004262,Secure Identity Management in a Service-Based E-Learning Environment,"E-learning environments and their system functionalities resemble one another to a large extent. Recent standardization efforts in e-learning concentrate on the reuse of learning material, but not on the reuse of application or system functionalities. The Learn Serve system under development at the University of Muenster builds on the assumption that a typical learning system is a collection of activities or processes that interact with learners and suitably chosen content, the latter in the form of learning Objects. This enables us to divide the main functionality of an e-learning system into a number of stand-alone applications or services. The realization of these applications based on the emerging technical paradigm of Web services then renders a wide reuse of functionality possible, thereby giving learners a higher flexibility of choosing content and functionalities to be included in their learning environment. In such a scenario, it must, however, be possible to maintain user identity and data across service and server boundaries. This paper presents an architecture for implementing user authentication and the manipulation of user data across several Web services. In particular, it demonstrates how to exploit the SPML and SAML standards so that cross-domain single sign-on can be offered to the users of a service-based learning environment. The paper also discusses how this is being integrated into LearnServe.

17004342,From Processes via Workflows to Services,"The intention of this paper is to present, in a nutshell, important contributing developments of the last decade that have resulted in a better understanding of applications and technologies needed for present-day service incarnations. We start from process modelling and management, which has its origins in the early 1990s, and which has paved the way for a new understanding of business dynamics and interactions. Technically, process modelling has first led to workflow management, in an attempt to (further) automate internal and external process executions. Yet what is well-understood by now is that process modelling alone is not sufficient, but needs to be complemented by an adequate process management. Once processes and workflows are in place, a common desire nowadays is their outsourcing, and this is a typical situation where Web services enter the picture. Services can also be seen as yet another approach to application integration, whose history has included such diverse directions as remote procedure call (RPC), object-oriented middleware and brokering, or application service provisioning (ASP). Web services have recently emerged as a primarily industrial paradigm for which there are many standards around already, yet their conceptual underpinnings are still in their infancy. The latter include, among others, quality of service (QoS) aspects, and the derivation of a service specification from a given workflow (or process) model.","['Process modelling', 'Web services', 'Workflows']","['Folksonomies, Repositories, Social tagging, Tag clouds, Technology-enhanced learning, Web 2.0']",en

17004737,Multi-Level Modeling of Web Service Compositions with Transactional Properties,"Web services have become popular as a vehicle for the design, integration, composition, reuse, and deployment of distributed and heterogeneous software. However, although industry standards for the description, composition, and orchestration of Web services have been under development, their conceptual underpinnings are not fully understood. Conceptual models for service specification are rare, as are investigations based on them. This paper presents and studies a multi-level service composition model that perceives service specification as going through several levels of abstraction. It starts from transactional operations at the lowest level and abstracts into activities at higher levels that are close to the service provider or end user. The authors treat service composition from a specification and execution point of view, where the former is about composition logic and the latter about transactional guarantees. Consequently, the model allows for the specification of a number of transactional properties, such as atomicity and guaranteed termination, at all levels. Different ways of achieving the composition properties and implications of the model are presented. The authors also discuss how the model subsumes practical proposals like the OASIS Business Transaction Protocol, Sun's WS-TXM, and execution aspects of the BPEL4WS standard.

Moreover the notion of governance structures - and subsequently the design framework - is expanded to reflect the specifics of multilevel forms of coordination, in particular mixed-mode electronic marketplaces. Mixed-mode marketplaces encompass different modes of coordination, including network coordination, under the institutional framework of a market. The notion of mixed-mode governance structures will be elaborated as it runs contrary to Williamson's distinct forms of governance, namely hierarchies, networks (or hybrids), and markets. The chapter concludes with suggestions for institutional design which reflect the competition among markets and other forms of governance. © 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","['Electronic Marketplaces', 'Institutions', 'Marketplace Design']",,en

Two different automotive cybermediaries categories are identified: automotive service brokers and automotive information brokers. Their initial success indicates that they might become serious competitors to the auto manufacturer's exclusive distribution systems. Our analysis focuses on the impact of the Web in an industry, which is characterized by physical products and infrastructures.

Electronic Customs, the transformation of paper-based trade documents to electronic ones, and the corresponding redesign of customs procedures, seems to be very promising approach to deal with this dilemma. However, while ICT is widely perceived as a key component of a solution, we argue in this paper that the complexity of the redesign of these electronic documents and procedures for international trade is far more problematic than traditional business process and network innovations. We identify key challenges facing the development and introduction of innovative eCustoms solutions and we outline conceptual and methodological approaches to address these challenges. In such a way, we outline a research approach for eCustoms innovation and transformation.","['eCustoms', 'Innovation', 'Research approach']",,en

This paper considers the impact of the Web on auction viability, operation, and diffusion. It does so by considering the impact of the Web on the various players in an auction and classifying types of auctions. The hypothesized impacts are briefly compared with the case of an established auction firm that moved to the Web and the market domain in which it operates. This is then used to contribute to the electronic markets debate and develop some hypotheses about the way in which Web-based markets that use auction mechanisms may evolve. Trust and quality are identified as key attributes of auctions that may result in a ""move to the middle"" rather than the establishment of purer market mechanisms. The growth of new cybermediaries and a possible extension of the supply chain are also noted.","['Electronic auctions', 'Electronic markets', 'Governance structures', 'Internet business models']",,en

Along with the adoption of EDIFACT, the banks have not only switched the message standard but also the governance form with respect to the provision of services. We want to give a stylized summary of the development of different generations of electronic banking solutions with a particular emphasis on technological attributes, such as functional properties and message standards, and discuss the strategic rationale of different governance forms chosen for the distribution of these services. From a theoretical point of view, a life-cycle concept is applied to describe the development paths of the different systems generations and to scrutinize substitution processes. In order to explain the low acceptance rate, we distinguish between the perspectives of the sponsors - that is, the banks - and the adopters - that is, the customers. Copyright © 1997 M.E.

At the same time, advances in ICT drive the emergence of new organisational forms such as the virtual organisation (VO). The VO is regarded a concept that provides firms with the necessary flexibility in changing markets. Modern ICT, i.e. communication systems and tools, is seen as the basis for work in the VO, where people with different competencies come together in short-term projects to exploit market opportunities. Yet the contingencies of adoption and use of communication systems in complex organisational environments are only poorly understood. While literature claims that modern ICT is at the heart of the VO, our case evidence paints a different picture ? only very lean media are used. We analysed communication practices at the group level using genre analysis. This leads us to formulate inherent dilemmas of the VO: Ultimately, it is the very structures of the VO that impede the emergence of communication practices and thus the adoption and diffusion of new ICTs.",Communication systems; adoption; virtual organisation; distributed work; virtual teams,"['Collective Action, Living Labs, Standardization']",en

Although multiple initiatives exist, no comprehensive and promising development and diffusion of a commonly applicable and interoperable solution has taken place so far. Agreeing on standards is an essential step on the road to a successful initiative on drug counterfeiting. To facilitate standardization, especially the initiation of a standardization process, we propose the concept of Living Labs as an innovative developing and testing environment serving multiple purposes. Testing solutions in real-life-contexts, aligning multiple interests and resulting in a pre-standard and a proof-of-concept are the advantages of this concept which facilitate the participation and coordinated action among a broad set of different stakeholders.","['Collective Action', 'Living Labs', 'Standardization']","['Appropriation, Distributed teams, Presence and awareness, Real Time Communication, Technology affordances, Technology-in-use, Virtual teams']",en

The existence of multiple parties involved in the standardisation process and the nature of the standard lead us to study the case from a collective action perspective. In doing so, the emergence and the diffusion of industrywide standards are being studied as distinct but connected set of dilemmas. The case leads us to theorise that strong industry associations play a significant role in the initiation and success of such standardisation ef forts on the industry level.

A limited set of integrated features enable instantaneous text, voice and video communication across the globe for free. However, an analysis of the features or affordances of the technology does not reveal the wealth and creativity of forms and modes of using SkypeTM. Hence we have collected five case vignettes to illustrate how SkypeTM has been embedded into the daily routines of distributed teams. From a theoretical lens, this comparative study shows how general purpose technology can only be properly understood in context because users shape the forms of usage to a large extent through processes of appropriation. The study also provides insights into processes of technology appropriation and the various roles and appearances of presence in virtual work settings.","['Appropriation', 'Distributed teams', 'Presence and awareness', 'Real Time Communication', 'Technology affordances', 'Technology-in-use', 'Virtual teams']",,en
17037988,Towards a Practice Understanding of the Creation of Awareness in Distributed Work,"Distributed, ICT-based work is becoming increasingly popular in and between organizations. However, such modes of working typically yield problems of creating and maintaining a mutual sense of awareness. Whereas in co-located teams awareness of others and their activities happens naturally and almost inevitably as part of daily routines, in virtual contexts awareness needs to be raised and facilitated. Existing literature treats awareness as determined by technology, hence technological design and the development of suitable IT artifacts and 'awareness features' are seen as crucial. We challenge this view after studying five cases, in which one real-time tool, SkypeTM, is used in quite diverse ways to create and maintain a sense of awareness. Our case analysis leads us to argue that awareness is part of shared social practices that are embedded in organizational contexts. Within these practices technology has been appropriated and embedded quite differently. We will spell out a practice theoretical understanding of awareness creation and suggest a re-conceptualization of awareness and its sister concepts presence and co-presence. We conclude with some implications for further research.","['Awareness', 'Distributed work', 'Instant Messaging', 'Practice theory', 'Presence', 'Skype TM']",,en

17039484,Strategic channel alignment: an analysis of the configuration of physical and virtual marketing channels,"Extensive integration of online and offline channels is often described as the most preferable strategy for multi channel retailing. However, empirical findings challenge this assumption by showing that retailers choose a variety of disparate multi channel strategies. Given this variety, we conjecture that there is no single best approach to multi channel retailing, but that, depending on the general marketing strategy, different multi channel strategies can be suitable for retailers. We develop a model of strategic channel alignment and identify four different paths of channel alignment, which we use to reconstruct and interpret multi channel strategies as an alignment of general marketing strategy and online strategy. An application of the model to four prominent and successful cases from the grocery retailing industry shows that although the companies pursue fundamentally different multi channel strategies, they can all be considered as examples of successful alignment and mature multi channel strategies. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","['E-commerce', 'Grocery retailing', 'Multi channel management', 'Strategic alignment']",,en

17039715,The Role of Intermediaries in Electronic Marketplaces: Developing a Contingency Model,"Early research in electronic markets seemed to suggest that e-commerce transactions would result in decreased costs for buyers and sellers alike, and would therefore ultimately lead to the elimination of intermediaries from electronic value chains. However, a careful analysis of the structure and functions of electronic marketplaces reveals a different picture. Intermediaries provide many value-adding functions that cannot be easily substituted or 'internalized' through direct supplier-buyer dealings, and hence mediating parties may continue to play a significant role in the e-commerce world. In this paper we provide an analysis of the potential roles of intermediaries in electronic markets and we articulate a number of hypotheses for the future of intermediation in such markets. Three main scenarios are discussed: the disintermediation scenario, in which market dynamics will favour direct buyer-seller transactions; the reintermediation scenario, in which traditional Intermediaries will be forced to differentiate themselves and reemerge in the electronic marketplace; and the cybermediation scenario, in which wholly new markets for intermediaries will be created. The analysis suggests that the likelihood of each scenario dominating a given market is primarily dependent on the exact functions that intermediaries play in each case. A detailed discussion of such functions is presented in the paper, together with an analysis of likely out-comes in the form of a contingency model for intermediation in electronic markets.","['Contingency model', 'Disintermediation', 'Economics', 'Electronic commerce', 'Electronic markets']",,en

17039869,Cybermediation in Auto Distribution: Channel Dynamics and Conflicts,"The emerging electronic market space will change the structure of value chains and will - in particular - increase the presence of intermediaries so called cybermediaries. The paper examines the roles and functions of these new players and their impact on established distribution and sales channels in the case of the automotive industry. Two different automotive cybermediaries categories are identified: automotive service brokers and automotive information brokers. Their initial success indicates that they might become serious competitors to the auto manufacturer's exclusive distribution systems. Our analysis focuses on the impact of the Web in an industry, which is characterized by physical products and infrastructures. Based on this analysis and reconstruction of current trends in the auto industry, we will discuss strategic options for auto manufacturers using a blend of market brand strength mixed with the concept of an on-line community.",,,en
17039944,Web-based Procurement: New Roles for Intermediaries,"The electronic markets vs. electronic hierarchies debate initiated by (Malone et al. 1987) has been superseded by the discussion about dis- or reintermediation in the electronic marketplace. Many of the arguments given for either side are equally correct - because the arguments have been applied to different domains in different situations from specific perspectives - and yet the debate falls short of covering the complexity and dynamics of the ongoing market structure change. The goal of this paper is therefore to develop a more differentiated framework that facilitates the understanding of chances and threats resulting from inter- and cybermediation. The framework suggests to distinguish roles, opportunities and threats for cybermediaries in different situations. While the framework is meant to structure the debate in general, we will focus on public sector procurement to show its application.","['Cybermediary', 'Cybermediation', 'Dis-', 'Electronic procurement', 'Hierarchy', 'Intermediary', 'Market', 'Network', 'Public procurement', 'Re-']",,en

Although existing inefficiencies and cost pressures provide a strong rationale for electronic market solutions, most attempts have failed so far. Based on an overview of the so-called electronic transportation exchanges we will analyze the factors that were involved in the repeated failures. By using a multilayer framework that integrates established research approaches for interorganizational systems (IOS), we argue that the failures provide valuable insights for the configuration of electronic commerce (EC) systems in general and in particular for the transportation exchanges that are currently emerging on the Internet.",,,en
17040173,The Impact of the Web on Auctions: Some Empirical Evidence and Theoretical Considerations,"Since the extensive diffusion of the World Wide Web, on-line auctions have proliferated. This paper considers the impact of the Web on auction viability, operation, and diffusion. It does so by considering the impact of the Web on the various players in an auction and classifying types of auctions. The hypothesized impacts are briefly compared with the case of an established auction firm that moved to the Web and the market domain in which it operates. This is then used to contribute to the electronic markets debate and develop some hypotheses about the way in which Web-based markets that use auction mechanisms may evolve. Trust and quality are identified as key attributes of auctions that may result in a ""move to the middle"" rather than the establishment of purer market mechanisms. The growth of new cybermediaries and a possible extension of the supply chain are also noted.","['Electronic auctions', 'Electronic markets', 'Governance structures', 'Internet business models']","['Diffusion of EDI, Financial EDI, Life-cycle theory, Substitution of standards']",en

Along with the adoption of EDIFACT, the banks have not only switched the message standard but also the governance form with respect to the provision of services. We want to give a stylized summary of the development of different generations of electronic banking solutions with a particular emphasis on technological attributes, such as functional properties and message standards, and discuss the strategic rationale of different governance forms chosen for the distribution of these services. From a theoretical point of view, a life-cycle concept is applied to describe the development paths of the different systems generations and to scrutinize substitution processes. In order to explain the low acceptance rate, we distinguish between the perspectives of the sponsors - that is, the banks - and the adopters - that is, the customers. Copyright © 1997 M.E.

17040478,The Configuration of Inter-organisational Relations,"Based on recent literature on the impact of inter-organizational information systems (IOS) on industrial organization, this paper proposes a framework for research into the interdependencies between IOS and coordination strategy. The elements of the framework are: (1) market structure; (2) governance forms; (3) relationship dimensions and (4) enterprise resources. It is suggested that these four elements at the same time affect and are affected by coordination strategy which focuses on inter-organizational relations. The research proposition is that inter-organizational arrangements have to be interpreted as complex, multilayer configurations of organizational parameters. The composition and flexible adaptation of these configurations - rather than the selection of one efficient governance form - and the related design of IOS are the major tasks of coordination strategy. The design parameters are related to the elements of the framework: (1) the position of the enterprise in inter-organizational relations, be it a network, groups of networks or markets; (2) combinations of governance forms with different partners; (3) combinations of governance forms within a given network of relations referring to the different layers in inter-organizational relations, namely the institutional, operational and technical layers and (4) combinations of (inter-) organizational arrangements for the use and development of resources. EUROSELECT, a horizontal network of European grocery wholesalers, is used as an example to illustrate how different contingencies affect the inter-organizational design and why the complex configuration of relations is chosen. © 1996 Operational Research Society Ltd.",,,en
17040555,The Impact of Public Policy on the Diffusion and Implementation of EDI - An Evaluation of the TEDIS Programme,"The objective of this paper is to scrutinise the impact of public policy on the diffusion and implementation of electronic data interchange among firms (EDI): How do specific measures and policies in general, affect a particular company's accrued costs for business transactions entered into and, more specifically, the costs to set up and maintain EDI links with other, both private and public business partners. The facilitation of EDI through regulatory, institutional and market policies is instrumental to the industrial policy of the CEC. It constitutes a major step in the direction of the Single (European) Market and the harmonisation of legal frameworks as well as business practices within the Common Market. Commencing with this emerging technology may be regarded as the critical move that will necessarily facilitate future harmonisation in an area where a mere minimum of national regulations exist to date, thereby making easier to promote EU regulations. It is shown, how the goals of the CEC (Commission of the European Communities) industrial policy have been applied to, and elaborated within, the TEDIS programme, one of its lesser know programmes. © 1995.","['Electronic data interchange', 'Industrial policy', 'Interorganisational systems', 'Transaction costs']",,en

Wir pl&auml;dieren f&uuml;r einen gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Realismus im Umgang mit VO, ihren Zielen und strukturellen Versprechungen. VO als Organisationsform sind arm an formellen Strukturen, was auf der Teamebene in der konkre-ten Projektarbeit zu Problemen f&uuml;hren kann.

17069961,Knowledge Governance in Virtual Corporations,"Today corporations are confronted by a fundamental, sustainable and often rapid change of their economic environment. Amongst others, new opportunities and risks face corporations, the competitive situation changes from local to global markets with a higher degree of competition. As a result, new organizational forms such as strategic alliances, joint ventures, strategic networks, virtual organizations, and other forms of inter-organizational co-operations have emerged. In this new environment, corporate governance has become a pivotal success factor for a sustainable development, and effective management of complex institutional structures, and overcoming environmental changes. This edited volume raises important questions relating to governance in a multi-national environment and is divided in two main parts.The first part of the book discusses ways to govern loosely linked international and transnational collaborations. Issues about the effectiveness and efficacy of &ldquo;good&rdquo; standards and ethical behaviours, Corporate Governance, Corporate Social Responsibility and Codes of Conducts are discussed. The second part of this book examines the impacts of the globalization of internal processes and knowledge management in international networks. Innovative approaches to govern these kinds inter-organizational arrangements are presented.",,,en
17070044,Einsatz von Sozialer Software für das Stakeholder Management,"Durch das Aufkommen von Sozialer Software, wie Wikis, Blogs und RSS, haben Internetnutzer neue M&ouml;glichkeiten der Informationssuche, der Interaktion und der Kollaboration erhalten. Einhergehend hat sich die Kommunikationskultur ver&auml;ndert und so die Entstehung von user generated content gef&ouml;rdert. Zerfa&szlig; identifiziert auf Grundlage von Web 2.0-Technologien und Konzepten einen Wandel von der einseitig orientierten Massen- bzw. Einkanal-Kommunikation hin zur interaktiven personalisierten Kommunikation und zum Dialog (Zerfa&szlig; 2008). Diese M&ouml;glichkeit wird f&uuml;r die private Kommunikation (bspw. mittels Social Network Sites, Webforen oder Blogs) genutzt. Aber auch Unternehmen, die mit Informationsanforderungen seitens vielf&auml;ltiger Anspruchsgruppen konfrontiert sind, werden in die Lage versetzt, die eigene Stakeholder-Kommunikation zur mehrdirektionalen Interaktion auszuweiten. Untersuchungen zeigen, dass Informationen im Internet die Meinungsbildung der Stakeholder-Gruppen beeinflussen k&ouml;nnen. So nutzen bspw. Kunden, potenzielle Arbeitnehmer, Investoren und Kooperationspartner das Internet, um Informationen &uuml;ber Unternehmen zu erhalten (Pleil 2008, Stieglitz et al. 2008). Neben den Unternehmensdaten, Produktinformationen und Serviceangeboten ist auch das unternehmerische Handeln, bspw. in Bezug auf die Unternehmenswerte und die Umsetzung der Corporate Social Responsibility f&uuml;r Stakeholdergruppen relevant (O&rsquo;Riordan &amp; Fairbrass 2008). Das Internet kann als zus&auml;tzlicher Kanal f&uuml;r den Zugang zu diesen Informationen und Wissen genutzt werden (Harrison et al. 2006). In der Literatur werden der Einsatz des Internet und das Potenzial innovativer Applikationen f&uuml;r die Unternehmenskommunikation bereits untersucht (z.B. Adams &amp; Frost 2003, Pressley 2006, Zerfa&szlig; 2008). Untersuchungen zeigen hierbei, dass insbesondere der Stakeholder-Dialog durch die Einbindung neuer Internet-Technologien verbessert und ausgebaut werden kann (z.B. Bussy et. al 2000, Unerman &amp; Bennett 2004). Verschiedene Typen Sozialer Software, wie Foren, Wiki-Systeme und Blogs sowie Video- und Audio-Streams werden schon jetzt von NGOs eingesetzt, um Stakeholder &uuml;ber einzelne Kampagnen und Aktivit&auml;ten zu informieren. Dar&uuml;ber hinaus betreiben NGOs Gruppen in Sozialen Netzwerken wie Facebook oder StudiVZ. Ziele sind es, den aktiven Austausch mit Mitgliedern zu f&ouml;rdern und den Aufbau einer Community zu unterst&uuml;tzen, um zus&auml;tzliche Mitglieder zu werben oder bestehende Mitglieder st&auml;rker zu binden (Schneider et al. 2008). In diesem Zusammenhang stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit deutsche Unternehmen bereits die Anwendungsm&ouml;glichkeiten Sozialer Software erkannt haben und nutzen, um mit Stakeholder-Gruppen zu kommunizieren und zu interagieren. Da bisher nur wenige empirische Untersuchungen vorliegen, hat dieser Beitrag das Ziel, Aussagen &uuml;ber die Potenziale Sozialer Software f&uuml;r die Stakeholder Kommunikation zu treffen und mittels einer Erhebung festzustellen, in welchem Umfang verschiedene Typen Sozialer Software eingesetzt werden. Einf&uuml;hrend erfolgt ein kurzer &Uuml;berblick &uuml;ber das Stakeholder-Relationship-Management sowie eine Abgrenzung zentraler Begriffe. Auf dieser Grundlage wird der Aufbau eines Rahmenmodells dargestellt, welches die Einsatzpotenziale verschiedener Komponenten Sozialer Software systematisiert. Eine empirische Untermauerung findet auf Basis einer Untersuchung der Webseiten von insgesamt 110 Unternehmen statt, die in den B&ouml;rsenindizes DAX, MDAX und TecDAX zusammengefasst sind. Ziel der Erhebung ist es, die im Einsatz befindlichen Web 2.0-Applikationen zu identifizieren und in nachfolgenden Untersuchungen inhaltlich zu analysieren. Ein abschlie&szlig;endes Fazit verdeutlicht die f&uuml;r die Untersuchung geltenden Einschr&auml;nkungen, fasst die wesentlichen Ergebnisse zusammen und liefert einen Ausblick f&uuml;r weitere Forschungsaktivit&auml;ten.",Web 2.0; Social Media; DAX,,de

Ideas generated by members of a virtual community can be utilized to improve and to innovate a company's value adding activities. However, the implementation and operation of virtual communities may have a considerable impact on financial performance measures of a company. Hence, to measure the profit-ability of a virtual community appropriately, means of efficiency calculations have to be employed. The objective of this chapter is, therefore, to develop a measurement framework to evaluate the financial performance of a virtual community. The focus is on calculating the total cost of ownership.

17070524,Coworker Governance in Open-Source Projects,"The monitoring, coordination, and control of coworkers are becoming increasingly important to attract coworkers for open-source projects. The number of open-source projects registered at large, online portals increased from less than 5,000 in 2000 to over 100,000 projects in 2004, and this trend will certainly continue. Therefore, open-source projects increasingly will face the problem of obtaining qualified work contributions at sufficient levels for their projects. As a consequence active governance of coworkers must be implemented. The suggested approach for coworker governance is based on the analysis of incentive mechanisms and lifecycle stages in open-source projects. It is necessary to adapt governance strategies, including active coworker acquisition, to project-specific characteristics. The central aspect of this contribution is the issue which measures open-source projects that can be addressed actively and consciously in order to acquire coworkers successfully on the ever more intensely embattled ""coworker market."" Established concepts of business management can rarely be applied to open-source communities since in most cases they depend on motivational mechanisms that are manifested as financial incentives. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a theory-based framework for the construction of learning arrangements with and in virtual worlds to impart particularly experiential learning. In order to validate the suggestions of the framework and hence, the effectiveness of virtual worlds for e-learning purposes, an e-learning concept is derived from the framework and a prototype of an experiential learning environment is set up on the basis of Second Life (SL).

17071443,Public Private Partnerships as an Inter-Organisational Initiative for the Diffusion of Broadband Technologies in Europe,"Broadband access plays a major role for the economic growth and for the social and cultural
development of urban and rural areas. Market failure within the broadband sector emerges often in
regions with a low density of population and weak economic conditions. A provision of broadband
infrastructure and services in such areas is not attractive to private investments because of a low or
even negative expected rate on return. In case of market failure, Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)
can be a powerful tool to encourage the deployment of information and communication technologies,
such as broadband services. A comparative case study analysis from ‘broadband-PPPs’ from different
countries depict that the organizational and financial funding models differ from project to project.
This contribution aims to encourage the discussion about different modes of funding and
organizational models of collaborations among public and private partners in the broadband sector.
For this reason, organizational and financing structures of PPP projects will be analyzed by six PPP

17071668,Online Communities for Customer Relationship Management on Financial Stock Markets - A Case Study from a Project at the Berlin Stock Exchange,"Retail trading on financial exchanges is always intermediated by banks. Thus, a direct link between exchange and retail investors does not exist. However, financial exchanges offer services to retail investors. Thus, from a marketing perspective, retail investors are their direct customers. Caused by the bank-intermediated transaction chain on financial retail exchanges a direct customer relationship management (CRM) among exchanges and their customers is hardly possible. This circumvents a customer oriented product and pricing policy. Thus banks, as they are nowadays the direct link between exchanges and retail investors, define the market micro structures of the financial exchanges to a large extend. This is true not only for the bank driven whole sale trading but as well for the retail trading. Ongoing developments of new exchange facilities for the retail trading, such as best execution functionalities, downsizing of the odd lots, adoption of trading hours, the emergence of electronic off exchange trading systems etc. show, that there is a need for improved retail trading platforms. To overcome these CRM related problems in the financial exchange industry a joined project between the Berlin Stock Exchange and the Potsdam University was set up to implement a platform for a direct CRM among retail investors and financial exchanges. This project relies on web 2.0 technologies to build up a virtual community where the exchange and retail investors can share information about needs, requirements, and ideas about the market model for a retail trading platform and other relevant trading and settlement facilities. The aim of this contribution is to describe this platform and their advantages for retail investors and for stock exchanges and to provide an outlook of the applicability of web 2.0 technologies in the financial exchange industry. An overview of the implementation and initialization phase of the community will be provided and first results and responses of community members are analysed.","['Community engineering', 'CRM', 'Stock exchange', 'Virtual community']",,en

17071890,Mobile learning by using ad hoc messaging networks,"The requirements of modern e-learning techniques change. Aspects such as community interaction, flexibility, pervasive learning and increasing mobility in communication habits become more important. To meet these challenges e-learning platforms must provide support on mobile learning. Most approaches try to adopt centralized and static elearning mechanisms to mobile devices.

A provision of broadband infrastructure and services in these areas is not attractive for private investments because of a low or even negative expected rate on return. The purpose of this paper is to identify different modes of public private partnership (PPP) funding and organizational models of collaborations among public and private partners to establish broadband infrastructures.

The practice shows that VCs need new forms of governance because the traditional mechanisms of control, management, and steering are hardly applicable. Until now there is only a few research related to the question how to govern VC. The main problems to govern a VC are to coordinate the communication among dispersed partners and to motivate employees to actively involve themselves into the network. Open source projects are confronted with similar problems. As several governance mechanisms are already analyzed in this context, the authors analyze and adopt governance concepts from open source projects to extract a governance framework for virtual corporations.

It automatically considers special needs like ambulances equipped for baby transportation or special decontamination equipment, e.g. to deal with an accident in a chemical factory. The rules used in the system are not hardcoded; thus, it is possible to redefine them on the fly without changing the program's source code. It is possible to load and save a rule set in case of a catastrophe. Furthermore, it is possible to automatically recalculate an already planned operation if it becomes clear that the rescue vehicles assigned are needed by a person with life-threatening injuries. © 2010 IMIA and SAHIA.

While read access through views is easy to handle, update requests through views are difficult in the sense that they have to be translated into appropriate updates on database relations. In this paper the ""constant complement translator"" approach towards view updating proposed by Bancilhon and Spyratos is revisited within the realm of SQL databases, and a novel characterization is established showing that constant complement translators exist precisely if users have a chance to undo all effects of their view updates using further view updates. Based on this characterization view updates with and without constant complement translators are presented. As it turns out that users cannot fully understand updates on views violating the constant complement principle, the application of this principle in the context of external schema design is discussed.",,,en

In this paper, we use multidimensional normal forms to define a set of Query/View/Transformation (QVT) relations to assure that the DW designed from user requirements agrees with the available data sources that will populate the DW. Thus, we propose a hybrid approach to develop DWs, i.e., we firstly obtain the conceptual schema of the DW from user requirements and then we verify and enforce its correctness against data sources by using a set of QVT relations based on multidimensional normal forms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,,en

17346942,Solving Summarizability Problems in Fact-Dimension Relationships for Multidimensional Models,"Multidimensional analysis allows decision makers to efficiently and effectively use data analysis tools, which mainly depend on multidimensional (MD) structures of a data warehouse such as facts and dimension hierarchies to explore the information and aggregate it at different levels of detail in an accurate way. A conceptual model of such MD structures serves as abstract basis of the subsequent implementation according to one specific technology. However, there is a semantic gap between a conceptual model and its implementation which complicates an adequate treatment of summarizability issues, which in turn may lead to erroneous results of data analysis tools and cause the failure of the whole data warehouse project. To bridge this gap for relationships between facts and dimension, we present an approach at the conceptual level for (i) identifying problematic situations in fact-dimension relationships, (ii) defining these relationships in a conceptual MD model, and (iii) applying a normalization process to transform this conceptual MD model into a summarizability-compliant model that avoids erroneous analysis of data. Furthermore, we also describe our Eclipsebased implementation of this normalization process. Copyright 2008 ACM.","['Data warehouse', 'Multidimensional modeling', 'Summarizability']",,en
17347019,A survey on summarizability issues in multidimensional modeling,"The development of a data warehouse (DW) system is based on a conceptual multidimensional model, which provides a high level of abstraction in accurately and expressively describing real-world situations. Once this model is designed, the corresponding logical representation must be obtained as the basis of the implementation of the DW according to one specific technology. However, even though a good conceptual multidimensional model is designed underneath a DW, there is a semantic gap between this model and its logical representation. In particular, this gap complicates an adequate treatment of summarizability issues, which in turn may lead to erroneous results of data analysis tools. Research addressing this topic has produced only partial solutions, and individual terminology used by different parties hinders further progress. Consequently, based on a unifying vocabulary, this survey sheds light on (i) the weak and strong points of current approaches for modeling complex multidimensional structures that reflect real-world situations in a conceptual multidimensional model and (ii) existing mechanisms to avoid summarizability problems when conceptual multidimensional models are being implemented. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As part of its 6th research framework, the European Commission (EC) funded a total of 130 so called networks of excellence (NoEs), a special kind of network with the purpose of strengthening and developing community, scientific and technological excellence by way of integrating existing and emerging research activities and by exchanging knowledge. In such NoEs electronic collaboration platforms are typically implemented to support collaboration between the individuals from the various research institutions. In this paper we investigate the adoption of a collaboration platform in one NoE case - the GARNET network. We find evidence that the platform is used for administrative purposes and to support the organisation of events. However, a web log analysis reveals a lack of adoption for its actual purpose - the support of collaborative research and knowledge exchange. A social network analysis further uncovers that the GARNET network is very fragmented on the social level, which points to a misfit between network structure and the positioning of the collaboration platform. Our findings lead us to suggest immediate next steps for this NoE and also point to general implications for network designers and future research in the domain.","['Adoption', 'Cooperation systems', 'Networks of excellence (NoE)', 'Research networks', 'Social network analysis (SNA)']",,en

On the basis of this distinction we take to the classification of SNSs grounded in real-life marketplace variety. In doing so, we identify seven different classes of SNSs. We argue that a typology of SNSs is useful for shaping our understanding of the diverse nature of ISN as existing in concrete manifestations. Most importantly, our classification makes accessible existing research for conceptually sound meta-analysis research. In order to fully grasp the phenomenon of ISN we also propose to include in the definition web sites that feature only certain aspects of ISN, while networking is not their core feature.

We find that the software interacts with different types of hardware and with institutionalized ideas and norms in the various contexts of user organizations in such a way that it renders defining usability as a property of the software artifact a pointless task. In fact, we question whether it is useful to conceptualize (workplace) software as artifacts with stable set of properties. Rather, we argue that usability manifests in the sociomaterial use context. We discuss methodological implications and identify areas for future research.","['Sociomateriality', 'Usability', 'Usability testing', 'Workplace software']",,en
17485880,E-Collaboration systems in Virtual Organizations - Recommendations for tool support based on genre analysis,"Advances in ICT have led to the proliferation of new organizational forms such as the virtual organization (VO). In fact, ICT is seen as the key enabler of VO. However, the notion of ICT in the VO literature is quite generic. Moreover, the VO itself is not well understood in regards to the actual work practices at the group level. Using a case study approach we investigate a subsidiary of a large multi-national electronics firm, which resembles the typical structures associated with a VO: a distinction of a long-term pool of competencies and the flexible configuration of geographically dispersed, short-term projects. We have analyzed communication practices using genre analysis. The contribution of our study is twofold: first, we provide an empirical account of communication practices (and their differences) in VO pool and projects. Second, we discuss appropriate e-collaboration systems to support the identified communication practices on pool and project-level. We conclude with some implications for future research.","['Cooperation systems', 'E-collaboration', 'Genre analysis', 'Virtual organization']","['Management des IT-Betriebs', ' IT Operations Management', ' IT Service Management', ' Information Technology Infrastructure Library', ' Microsoft Operations Framework']",en
17485956,"Should ""virtual"" mean ""vague""? A plea for more conceptual clarity in researching virtual organisations","Around fifteen years ago the concept ""virtual organisation"" (VO) was coined to describe changes in organisational structures of value creation as a reaction to developments in modern market environments. Since then, the VO as a concept has been used to describe different things in different contexts, so that today we find a rather unsatisfying mix of VO notions in the literature. Moreover, in many articles the VO remains underspecified and vague; sometimes even a mismatch exists between VO definitions provided and examples discussed. Motivated by these observations we carried out a literature analysis to explore differing notions of virtual organisation. The contribution of our study is twofold. First, we identify and describe in conceptual detail three distinct types of VO as the basis for future research endeavours. Second, we point to a need for conceptual clarity in researching VOs in practice, in light of the rather different management challenges of the three identified types.","['Literature analysis', 'Typology', 'Virtual Organisation (VO)']","['Communication media repertoire', ' Real Time Collaboration', ' Lotus® Sametime®', ' RTC adoption', ' RTC use', ' Practice perspective', ' Coordination of availability']",en

While Watson-Manheim and B&eacute;langer (2007) have focused on describing the existing media repertoires (set of available media and existing usage practices for specific purposes) and actual media usage decisions at two different companies at one point in time, this paper seeks to investigate dynamic transformations of communication media repertoires resulting from the introduction of a new platform technology over time. This paper is based on an in-depth case study on the roll-out of a Real Time Collaboration system to a financial service company. It reports on the resulting transformation of existing and the emergence of new usage practices for the purpose of coordinating team availability, thereby pointing out that (initial) usage practices of a new communication technology can only be understood against the background of already established practices and their history.",Communication media repertoire; Real Time Collaboration; Lotus® Sametime®; RTC adoption; RTC use; Practice perspective; Coordination of availability,,en

To overcome the high manual effort for teaching personnel, e-assessment systems are used. We propose an extension of EASy, a system for e-assessment in computer science and mathematics sciences education. It offers assessment of exercises that require higher-order cognitive skills. Our extension allows assessing programming exercises in conjunction with state of the art software development, in particular test-driven-development and back-to-back testing. It integrates a tool for automated test case generation. Test cases are pro-vided for students that upload their solution of programming exercises. They can use them to improve their solution and gain knowledge on software testing at the same time. Besides introducing our extension of EASy and distinguishing it from related work, we present an exemplary scenario. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we discuss findings from a survey. It was conducted with almost 200 students from a programming lecture. The study provided us both with quantitative results and qualitative feedback. Most students reflected positively on using EASy. Our general approach is feasible. However, several details require further investigation.","['E-assessment', 'E-learning', 'Examination', 'Software engineering', 'Software test', 'Software testing']","['Banking sector, Business process modeling language, Design science research, PICTURE']",en

It comprises three perspectiveswhich include the market environment, governance choicesby economic actors as well as the entrepreneurialdynamics of firms who initiate and operate marketplatforms as their business. In addition, we propose tostudy the interplay of technological, market, and institutionaldrivers in order to understand the phenomenon ofelectronic markets, which is also a precondition fordesigning electronic markets. Both activities involvemore than an economically motivated choice betweenthe discrete alternatives of markets and hierarchies.Rather, electronic markets are configurations acrossmultiple, interdependent dimensions: Technology is animportant force in shaping the field, but needs to becomplemented by considerations of the competitiveenvironment and the setting of rules in order to ensureefficient and effective plays of the game. Based on thisframework, this position paper develops six propositionsfor the future of electronic markets. Overall, theadvantages of intermediated structures, an ongoingtechnological sophistication, as well as further innovationin market mechanisms and services make electronicmarkets an enabler for many inter-organizational valuechains. While we are confident that the ingenuity ofinventors will yield a flow of innovations, recenteconomic crises have shed a dark shadow over thesustainability of electronic markets.

From a company's perspective it is important to understand the concrete contribution of an RFID system with regard to individual processes. The problem of profitability analyses in IS is that such technologies cannot be calculated as an economic standard investment. Hence, we propose a reference model as a generic knowledge base for referential RFID impacts. Our model supports the structuring and evaluation of RFID benefits along business processes. With this, we propose indicators for the derivation of an RFID cause-and-effectchain.

19484329,A Multi-Perspective Approach to Business Process Management in the Financial Sector,"In academia, business process management (BPM) in general is a major topic in teaching and research for many universities worldwide with large research institutions and professorships centered on this topic. However, currently most educational programs on BPM only address actual process management capabilities and do not provide sufficient insight into different industrial sectors and their individual needs with regard to BPM. Banks for example have very specific requirements for BPM (e.g. compliance, risk management, industrialization etc.). As a result, we developed a specialization module combined with a project seminar on the topic of BPM in the financial sector for the Bachelor program in Information Systems at the University of Muenster, Germany. In this article, we argue for its necessity, present the intention behind it and its justification, as well as draft the actual course procedure, while also illuminating the results of our first evaluation of the 1-year Bachelor specialization module. With this paper, we aim at providing other lecturers with reasonable insights and our experiences in setting up a business sector oriented BPM specialization module.","['Bachelor studies', 'Business process management', 'Information systems', 'Teaching course']","['Disintermediation, E-Health, Electronic intermediaries, Intermediation, Market dynamics, Value Analysis']",en
19484403,Automatic Identification of Structural Process Weaknesses in Flow Chart Diagrams,"Purpose: Financial institutions have been engaged in numerous business process reengineering (BPR) projects to make their organizations more efficient. However, the success of BPR projects in banks varies significantly and it remains a challenge to systematically discover weaknesses in business process landscapes. Based on the flow chart notation language this paper seeks to argue for the definition of weakness patterns in order to automatically identify potential process weaknesses. Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed weakness patterns in the flow chart notation language based on design science principles. To systematically derive process weaknesses that can be formalized, they analyzed each element of the flow chart notation as it was used in a real-life case. They furthermore tested the identified patterns in reality in order to evaluate their validity. Findings: The authors identified various potential weakness patterns that helped in automatically identifying weaknesses in process models. To some extent these findings are generalizable and transferable to other process modeling languages. Research limitations/implications: The pattern-based approach depends upon how well structural weakness patterns are defined and formalized. Identified problems remain ""potential"" weaknesses until a manual analysis reveals that the identified potential weaknesses are actually real weaknesses or not, e.g. due to law regulations. Practical implications: Using weakness patterns allows for automatically identifying potential process weaknesses in existing flow chart models. This way, this research helps in improving the so far manual analysis of process model landscapes. Originality/value: The approach is a new way of looking for process weaknesses through process weakness patterns. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","['Automatic business process analysis', 'Banks', 'Business process reengineering', 'Process weaknesses', 'Structural business process analysis']","['Change, Identity, IT-artifact, Process philosophy, Substance philosophy']",en

19577676,Analyzing the added value of electronic intermediaries in the Dutch health care sector,"The CareAuction intermediary offers a reverse auctioning platform to support the allocation of individual maternity care patient requests between purchasers of health insurance companies (acting on behalf of their policy holders) and care providers. Since its introduction in 2005, CareAuction has contributed to a small price drop of maternity care and induced competition on the supply-side of the market. This is a result of increased transparency for both (demand and supply) sides. The quality of the maternity care that is provided is monitored by a newly introduced quality evaluation system, which includes the patient and introduces quality as another competitive factor next to price. Next to CareAuction, other intermediaries are still active in the health care sector, supporting the allocation of care between insurance companies and care providers. Findings indicate that the influence of CareAuction leads to the disintermediation of at least one other intermediary. Theory on electronic intermediaries and market dynamics is used to identify the added values that these two intermediaries (CareAuction and LTZ) create for the purchasers and providers of maternity care in the context of the maternity care market.","['Disintermediation', 'E-Health', 'Electronic intermediaries', 'Intermediation', 'Market dynamics', 'Value Analysis']",,en
19580540,Metaphysics of Change and Identity,"Several authors have claimed the need of the IS community to theorize the IT-artifact. Additionally, phenomena of 'change' in all its facets assume a prominent role in information systems research. This paper is targeting at the intersection of research on change and the IT-artifact. The lack of longitudinal studies in the IS-literature has obscured the challenges of theorizing the IT-artifact over time. This paper raises the question under what conditions an IT-artifact persists through time as one and the same object. By exploring the metaphysical assumptions of our common understanding of the IT-artifact the inadequacy of current conceptualizations of change and IT is demonstrated. The paper shows that the commonly held identity bases on a substance philosophical viewpoint. A conceptualization of identity based on process philosophy is introduced as an alternative that avoids shortcomings of the former.

This paper argues that this is even more challenging when considering inter-organizational information systems (IOIS). After pointing to methodological and theoretical problems of researching IOIS this paper develops a different research approach. It proposes the notion of identity as a concept to study the IT-artifact. This paper works out a theoretical framework that blends the Gibsonian notion of affordance with that of organizational identity. In his work, Gibson emphasizes the importance of perspective. In order to account for different perceptions of affordances of the IT-artifact, organizational identity is discussed as an important element of perception. By combining the notions of affordance and organizational identity a new framework for studying IS in general and IOIS in particular is proposed.","['Affordances', 'IT-artifact', 'Organizational identity']","['diffusion', ' adoption', ' cloud-storage', ' project report']",en

This seemingly paradoxical coexistence of change and persistence is at the core of this paper. A theoretical apparatus is needed that may account for both phenomena over extended periods of time. Against this backdrop the notion of evolution of IOIS is explored. The paper proposes the theoretical concepts of ""natural drift"" and ""structural coupling"" as a promising venue for an evolutionary perspective on IOIS.

19580765,Affordances of Interorganisational Information Systems (IOIS) - A Pharmacist's Perspective,"The IS research community is still struggling with a proper theorisation of the IT-artefact. The debate manifests in questions regarding the effect of IT (Markus and Silver 2008), the identity of systems (Reimers et al. 2009), or more generally the appropriate theoretical tools for studying these systems. Part of the quest for theorising the IT-artefact is whether technology possesses inherent properties affecting human behaviour or if technology is a product of a social construction? The notion of 'affordance' seeks to overcome this dualism by positioning itself as a relational concept. An 'affordance' is mutually constituted by subject and object. This paper uses the notion of 'affordance' to analyse an electronic ordering system between pharmacies and wholesalers. The paper aims to scrutinise different means of ordering from a pharmacist's perspective. In doing so, benefits as well as challenges of using 'affordances' to study the IT-artefact are exemplified. The paper demonstrates that 'affordance' as an analytical tool offers a much richer analysis of empirical data than a mere description of functional properties would allow. Despite its merits, the paper finds that the notion of 'affordance' requires theoretical extensions in order to render it more suitable for the study of interorganisational information systems.","['Affordances', 'Ecological psychology', 'Interorganisational information system', 'IT-artefact']","['Cloud service', ' Education', ' Infrastructure', ' University']",en

The need for a new concept is motivated against the backdrop of a case study covering the evolution of an electronic ordering system over almost three decades. Subsequently, the case study is used to illustrate the applicability of the concept to the empirical data.

Electronic Government, or E-Government, is widely regarded as a disruptor of traditional e-government service provision through greater citizen access, enhanced democracy, improved information quality, and a range of governmental efficiencies. Local government has been a key e-government focus for many nations due to the wide and varied interactions these governmental agencies have with citizens. A gap in the literature exists that monitors the development of local e-government, especially from the policy maker perspective, of This study presents the findings of a longitudinal study exploring the development of local e-government in New Zealand - from the policy makers' perspective. All local and regional authorities in New Zealand were surveyed in 2000, 2004, and 2012 with the goal of understanding the key considerations associated with the development of e-government strategies and subsequent implementation of associated infrastructure. While local e-government development has been more incremental than transformational, there has been a trend towards greater consideration of citizen-focused issues including the likes of Consumer Confidence, Trust, Accessibility, The Digital Divide, Indigenous Peoples, Security, and Privacy. This offers a degree of reassurance that local authorities remain, and are indeed increasingly, focused on the provision of enhanced services to the communities they serve.","['E-Government', 'Governmental Issues', 'Local Government', 'Policy Maker Perspective']",,en

19755615,Invigorating Event-driven Process Chains – Towards an integrated meta model for EPC standardization,"When deciding about appropriate modelling languages, the degree of standardization often represents an important decision criterion. Although the EPC is commonly used for process modelling in the last decades, the absence of an official standard leads more and more to its non-consideration.

It is said to be able to increase work productivity and simultaneously lower costs in organizations. However, institutions of higher education, like universities, remain hesitant to adopt it. The 'NSA scandal' and similar revelations lead to a sharp decline in trust (especially in Europe) in commercial cloud computing providers like Dropbox and Google.

This has to be reflected by the planning processes and algorithms being utilized in the different stages of a supply chain. In the context of production planning, meta-heuristics are usually applied due to their ability to handle high complex problems. As a consequence, these algorithms require adaptation to the new scenario or even new solution approaches/strategies have to be devised. However, designing a meta-heuristic of good performance for a problem is a hard task, since it requires deep knowledge on the problem, as well as on the meta-heuristic side. Therefore, the existence of supporting guidelines for meta-heuristics might ease and speed-up the adaptation or design of these algorithms to better cope with the problem. In this paper, meta-heuristics are deconstructed into its components and an approach for component-based analysis is proposed to gain knowledge about their performance and how they perform the search. Based on the results of this analysis, guidelines can be devised. The proposed approach is applied for analyzing components of a good performing Genetic Algorithm (GA) for multi-level capacitated lot sizing problem (MLCLSP) and initial guidelines for the construction of GA in the domain of MLCLSP are generated.",,,en

Data from comScore is analysed using an innovative application of set theory. ComScore is a leading commercial provider of business intelligence and consumer analytics based on its worldwide panel of two million online users. The search process is modelled using the concept of the consideration set based on primary search with the airline websites and secondly by the use of online travel agents and meta-search engines, which are termed comparison websites. Three generic search models are proposed: (1) primary search with airline websites only; (2) search of comparison websites only; (3) a combination of primary search and comparison websites. Each generic search model accounts for a significant proportion of overall users in both markets. The consideration sets are 2.58 in Germany and 2.74 in the United States. It is shown that the use of comparison websites significantly increases the propensity to conduct additional primary search based on analysis of all major airline pairs in both markets.

Each receiving peer in return provides its resources to the system. Since these systems operate in a completely distributed manner, it is of particular importance, to prevent malicious members from harvesting important topology information or influencing the streaming system to their needs. In this article, we analyze potential attack methods on multiple-tree-based P2P streaming systems, discuss important design decisions to constrain the impact of malicious behaviour, and we introduce the new concept of peer testaments. By analyzing existing systems, we show that so far only few attention has been given to the design of unexploitable construction mechanisms.

19792458,On Virtualization-based Network Support for Peer-assisted Live-Streaming Applications,"IPTV will be one of the main drivers of network innovation in the near future. Its bandwidth demands, especially if combined with HDTV, require smart algorithms for content distribution. One approach that is currently discussed intensively is Application Layer Multicast (ALM), which allows to scale to large node numbers by incorporating the resources of participating peers. In addition, locality-aware ALM approaches can distribute content close to the edges of the network and thus are able to relieve core networks from traffic. In this work, we propose to combine ALM with virtual routers that assist in content distribution, so-called ALM-Routers. They can be moved between distinct network positions and are inspired by current research towards a future Internet. Furthermore, we propose adaptation algorithms that operate solely on local knowledge and optimize ALM-Router positions as well as their overlay neighborhood. As our simulation results indicate, already a small fraction of such virtual nodes deployed on core network routers, decrease the overall traffic amount. Moreover, a subsequent optimization of the positions of ALM-Routers and the optimization of their overlay neighborhood induces additional considerable traffic savings compared to a static placement. © 2011 IEEE.",,"['DoS attacks, Pull-based P2P streaming, Resilience']",en
19792540,On Complexity and Approximability of Optimal DoS Attacks on Multiple-Tree P2P Streaming Topologies,"We investigate the hardness of malicious attacks on multiple-tree topologies of push-based Peer-to-Peer streaming systems. In particular, we study the optimization problem of finding a minimum set of target nodes to achieve a certain damage objective. For this, we differentiate between three natural and increasingly complex damage types: global packet loss, service loss when using Multiple Description Coding, and service loss when using Forward Error Correction. We show that each of these attack problems is NP-hard, even for an idealized attacker with global knowledge about the topology. Despite tree-based topologies seem susceptible to such attacks, we can even prove that (under strong assumptions about NP) there is no polynomial time attacker, capable of guaranteeing a general solution quality within factors of c1 log(n) and c22log1-δn (with n topology nodes, δ = 1 /log logd n for d < 1/2 and constants c1, c 2), respectively. To our knowledge, these are the first lower bounds on the quality of polynomial time attacks on P2P streaming topologies. The results naturally apply to major real-world DoS attackers and show hard limits for their possibilities. In addition, they demonstrate superior stability of Forward Error Correction systems compared to Multiple Description Coding and give theoretical foundation to properties of stable topologies. © 2011 IEEE.","['approximation', 'attack stability', 'complexity theory', 'P2P streaming', 'topology']","['Android, HosTaGe, Mobile honeypot, Security']",en
19792622,On the Dependencies between Source Neighbors in Optimally DoS-stable P2P Streaming Topologies,"We study tree-based peer-to-peer streaming topologies that minimize the maximum damage that can be caused by the failure of any number of peers. These optimally stable topologies can be characterized by a distinctive damage sequence. Although checking whether a given topology is optimally stable is a co-NP-complete problem, a large subclass of these topologies can be constructed by applying a simple set of rules. One of these rules states that every optimally stable topology must have optimally stable inter-dependencies between the nodes directly adjacent to the streaming source (called heads). However, until now, only a single stable head topology was known. In this article, we first give a short outline to previous results about optimally stable topologies. Then, we identify necessary and sufficient requirements for the optimal stability of head topologies, thereby largely increasing the number of known representatives from this class. All requirements can be checked in polynomial time. Furthermore, we show how to efficiently decide stability for head topologies with at most four stripes and give a procedure that, given a stable topology, produces a stable topology with an arbitrary number of stripes. Reversing this procedure can also speed up stability testing. Finally, we describe strategies how stable head topologies can be constructed in real-world streaming systems. © 2011 IEEE.",,,en

19793027,This Network is Infected: HosTaGe - a Low-Interaction Honeypot for Mobile Devices,"In recent years, the number of sophisticated cyber attacks has increased rapidly. At the same time, people tend to utilize unknown, in terms of trustworthiness, wireless networks in their daily life. They connect to these networks, e.g., airports, without knowledge of whether they are safe or infected with actively propagating malware. In traditional networks, malicious behavior can be detected via Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, IDSs cannot be applied easily to mobile environments and to resource constrained devices. Another common defense mechanism is honeypots, i.e., systems that pretend to be an attractive target to attract malware and attackers. As a honeypot has no productive use, each attempt to access it can be interpreted as an attack. Hence, they can provide an early indication on malicious network environments. Since low interaction honeypots do not demand high CPU or memory requirements, they are suitable to resource constrained devices like smartphones or tablets. In this paper we present the idea of Honeypot-To-Go. We envision portable honeypots on mobile devices that aim on the fast detection of malicious networks and thus boost the security awareness of users. Moreover, to demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal we present our prototype HosTaGe, a low-interaction honeypot implemented for the Android OS.

19793109,Resilient and Underlay-aware P2P Live-Streaming,"Application Layer Multicast (ALM) represents a cost-efficient way to disseminate content in large scale. However, as it relies on end-systems in content distribution, it can be easily attacked and thus requires specific measures to increase its resilience against attacks. Besides attacks on end-users, few attention has been paid to attacks on the underlying transport network so far. When the overlay is not constructed in an underlay-aware manner, several overlay links may rely on the same link or router in the underlay. Hence, a single underlay failure may result in multiple, simultaneous overlay failures. Moreover, without considering the underlying transport network an inefficient content distribution can be the result. For this reason the ALM induced traffic load in transport networks can become rather large. In this article, we propose a construction algorithm for ALM topologies that incorporates information about the underlying network to improve their resilience against underlay failures, to maintain resilience against overlay attacks, and to increase the efficiency of the content distribution. Our simulation results indicate that the underlay dependence of the established ALM overlays can be nearly halved compared to overlays that do not use information about the transport network in their construction. As a result, the ALM induced traffic load in transport networks decreases considerably. In addition, the results indicate that our topologies are likewise resilient to underlay as well as overlay attacks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",fischer14underlay,,en
19793189,On Advanced Monitoring in Resilient and Unstructured P2P Botnets,"Botnets are a serious threat to Internet-based services and end users. The recent paradigm shift from centralized to more sophisticated Peer-to-Peer (P2P)-based botnets introduces new challenges for security researchers. Centralized botnets can be easily monitored, and once their command and control server is identified, easily be taken down. However, P2P-based botnets are much more resilient against such attempts. To make it worse, botnets like P2P Zeus include additional countermeasures to make monitoring and crawling more difficult for the defenders.

However, collaboration by exchanging suspicious alarms among all interconnected sensors in CIDSs does not scale with the size of the IT infrastructure; hence, detection performance and communication overhead, required for collaboration, must be traded off. We propose to partition the set of considered sensors into subsets, or communities, as a lever for this trade off. The novelty of our approach is the application of ensemble based learning, a machine learning paradigm suitable for distributed intrusion detection.

19794160,AnonPubSub: Anonymous Publish-Subscribe Overlays,"Publish-subscribe is an increasingly popular messaging pattern for distributed systems, supporting scalable and extensible programming, and optimal spatial, temporal, and control-flow decoupling of distributed components. Publish-subscribe middleware and methods were extended towards supporting security, in particular confidentiality, and increased availability, yet a few prior works addressed anonymity of participants. Anonymity of senders and receivers may however be crucial, e.g., for supporting freedom of expression in regimes where political repression and censorship prevail. In this article, we review basic security and privacy requirements and introduce a new attacker model based on statistical disclosure, used to challenge anonymity. We elaborate on design options for privacy-preserving publish-subscribe systems and present a novel system that leverages peer-to-peer networking concepts; this novel approach protects subscriber anonymity by means of Probabilistic Forwarding (PF) and through a novel so-called Shell Game (SG) algorithm. We verify our solution against the requirements and provide a simulation-based analysis of the effectiveness of our approaches in light of our attacker model. The results show that the SG algorithm efficiently protects subscriber anonymity, and that anonymity sets can be adjusted via PF.","['Anonymity', 'Overlay networks', 'Publish-subscribe']","['IS Strategy', ' Information Architecture']",en
19794479,Development and application of a maturity measurement framework for supply chain flexibility,"Today's supply chains (SC) are acting in an ever more complex, dynamic and uncertain business environment. Increased customer expectations regarding product variety, shortened product life-cycles and volatile demand motivate the need for supply chain flexibility (SCF) in the face of stiff competition and environmental changes. Flexibility processes implementation in supply chains varies according to companies and SC, due to several factors. The level of awareness of the need for flexibility, the proactive or reactive plan and use of flexibility; and the focus on the SC as a whole or in single companies are examples. The concept of process maturity assumes that the implementation of procedures is carried out in multiple evolutionary and successive stages, which are explicitly defined, managed and measured. Maturity models give companies indicators as well as guidance to analyze and subsequently improve their processes. Despite several SC maturity models in the literature, there is not a model focusing on the maturity of SC flexibility processes, like the one intended in this paper. The levels of the maturity of SCF are (1) none, (2) inter-firm, (3) SC reactive, (4) SC proactive, and (5) SC paradigmatic. Each level has five dimensions: (1) Collaboration, (2) Information Technology, (3) Information flow, (4) Internal flexibility types and (5) Performance measurement. A toy case drawn from the automotive industry illustrates the application of the model from a dyad perspective. Based on the findings, SC flexibility maturity levels are measured in each of the analyzed links and areas for improvement are identified.",Supply Chain Flexibility; Maturity Model,"['Cloud Computing', ' Data as a Service', ' Data Marketplace', ' Data Marketplace Survey', ' Data Marketplace', ' Development']",en

New data sources, like online social media provide an increasing volume of data that promises improvements in situation awareness. But it remains difficult to focus data collection on information needs and integrate relevant information back into decision-making. In this paper, we present the observation-aware Decision Model and Notation (oDMN), which connects tasks, decisions, information and data sources based on standardized models and notations as well as on domain-specific information models. The oDMN allows for deriving information requirements and determining the impact of incoming observations on relevant tasks and decisions. To demonstrate its usefulness, we apply oDMN to a case centered on logistics operations during the 2015 Nepal earthquake response. The results show that oDMN is indeed able to formally connect tasks, decisions, information and data sources, and thus support better decision-making.",Katastrophenmanagement; Humanitäre Logistik,"['Humanitarian Logistics', ' Performance Measurement', ' IT Requirements', ' Logistics dashboards']",en

Incomplete, ambiguous, and changing requirements are the number one reason for failure of software development projects. Customer and supplier have to interchange information for closing requirement gaps. However, gathering and interchanging information generates undesirable costs. The most commonly used contract model is a fixed-price contract. Under this condition, the supplier is forced to cooperate, whereas the customer prefers to defect regarding closing requirement gaps. In support of our theoretical argument, we carried out an empirical investigation. We derive suggestions for improving the fixed-price contract design of software development projects as well as for the cooperation behavior during the project.",Software development project; Outsourcing; Failure; Information asymmetry; Dilemma structures; Incomplete contract,"['Algorithmic skeletons, GPGPU, High-level parallel programming, Java']",en
19864429,Forensics of High-Quality JPEG Images with Color Subsampling,"Detecting prior compression is an essential task in image forensics and can be used to detect forgery in digital images. Many approaches focus on grayscale images and assume compressions with a low quality factor which often leave visible artifacts in the image. In practice, however, color images and high quality compression are much more relevant and widespread. Block convergence has been proposed to estimate the number of JPEG compressions with quality factor 100 for grayscale images and has been shown to produce accurate results [1]. This paper extends block convergence to the more relevant case of color images where chrominance subsampling and color conversion make the estimation more complex. By observing block convergence for macro-blocks over multiple recompressions we are able to produce accurate estimates for color images. Oftentimes block convergence for color images enables similar accuracy and allows to detect more recompressions compared to grayscale images, while maintaining a good distinction between never and once compressed images.",Color; Convergence; Discrete cosine transforms; Gray-scale; Image coding; Image color analysis; Transform coding,,en

In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, humanitarian decision makers have to assure that action is prompt and targeted although confronted with lack of needed information about the highly complex and dynamic operational context in the affected area. Mobile technology and crowdsourcing have emerged as technologies that can help supply much needed information. GDACSmobile is a mobile-enabled IT solution for the assessment of needs, issues of access, infrastructure damage and other cross-cutting operational issues. In contrast to similar tools, e.g. Ushahidi or KoBoToolbox, GDACSmobile is an integrated solution addressing both the general public and professional responders, which closes the information cycle between disaster managers and the affected population. After all, most first responders are local citizens. In this paper, we introduce the context of the application and its concept, including descriptions of user groups and information flows that enable effective quality control of information. Subsequently an application scenario based on the 2015 Nepal Earthquake illustrates the value of using GDACSmobile to involve logisticians and assessment experts to inform and control the processes of data collection and information analysis, wherein professional responders and citizens act as primary data sources.",Needs assessment; damage assessment; crisis management,"['information infrastructure', ' practice theory', ' medication management', ' compliance']",en

19876487,Reengineering an Approach to Model-Driven Development of Business Apps,"Despite a perceived convergence in mobile application development, platforms such as Android and iOS remain largely incompatible. Supporting multiple platforms currently requires either separate native development (for each system) or utilization of a cross-platform development framework. While many such frameworks have been developed, only few are mature and even less are used widely, let alone commercially. Moreover, they typically are limited with regard to performance and to preserving a native look & feel. Worst of all, their usefulness for businessapps is limited due to their low level of abstraction. In this paper, we take a closer look at an academic prototype that employs modeldriven software development (MDSD) for a cross-platform framework that facilitates business app development. We discuss lessons learned from its development and early application, reengineering it with b usiness producibility in mind. We aim at closing a design-oriented research gap: we describe what the approach to employ MDSD in mobile computing is and to what extent it might be useful in general. These findings are embedded in a case-study inspired discussion of the aims of reengineering the approach.","['App', 'MDSD', 'Mobile computing', 'Model-driven']",,en

In order to fully exploit their parallel computing capability, programmers have to deal with low-level concepts of parallel programming. These low-level concepts constitute a high barrier to efficient development of parallel applications. A higher level of abstraction would be desirable. In order to assist programmers in developing parallel applications Algorithmic Skeletons have been proposed. They encapsulate well-defined, frequently recurring parallel programming patterns, thereby shielding programmers from low-level aspects of parallel programming. The main contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of data parallel skeletons with GPU support in Java. Additionally, on the basis of three benchmark applications, including Matrix multiplication, N-Body calculations, and Shortest paths, we evaluate the performance of the presented implementation on a GPU cluster.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'GPGPU', 'High-level parallel programming', 'Java']",,en

19896427,Infrastructure Innovation in Health Care – The Example of Automatic Drug Dispensing in Germany,"Comprehensive medication management for polypharmacy patients has been recognized as a key area of health care in need of improvement and innovations: it affects a growing number of patients, has huge financial implications and ties into broader issues such as patient health and medication safety, medication records, coordination across different medical specialists, cooperation between medical doctors and pharmacists. It fits the characteristics of an infrastructure as a constellation of practices. Given the prevalence of national regulation, we have been studying the public discourse about improving medication management in Germany over the course of the past 10 years. Specifically, this paper investigates the development of an initiative to introduce industrial automatic dose dispensing (ADD), i.e. the large scale production of patient specific blister packs for solid oral medicines, as an infrastructure innovation in the German healthcare system. We trace the arguments of both opponents and proponents of this innovation and theorize the outcome so far. ADD has been introduced in a number of countries, namely Northern Europe, the Netherlands; the US, Canada, Japan and Australia (Bell et al. 2013). While some of the effects of ADD are contested, overall it has been positively assessed. Since regulatory preconditions for the industrial creation of ADD in Germany have been put in place, trials were run by two industrial ADD operators. Additionally, a number of smaller blister centers have been set up by pharmacies at a regional level. Yet, in contrast to other countries, Germany still lacks a regulatory and reimbursement framework to facilitate routine use of ADD at a national level. The goal of this paper is to provide explanations for the impediments of infrastructure innovation in the field of medication management and to illustrate ways of theorizing that can be transferred to other areas as well. Actors in the health care sector have sided either with the opponents or proponents of ADD as a solution to medication management. Due to this situation, we find that attempts to introduce ADD as a solution to existing problems with medication management are unlikely to succeed on a national level anytime soon. Our analysis of the discourse that unfolded over the last years reveals a number of challenges characteristic for infrastructure innovation: (1) The ADD initiative illustrates the tension between design and emergence in infrastructure innovation. (2) Digital disruption (or disruptive innovation) plays a major role in explaining the reluctance for infrastructure innovation. (3) Infrastructure innovation as institutional innovation relies heavily on collective action. As such the discourse is characterized by the forming of coalitions striving to frame the debate and gain ownership of meanings. Yet, the complexity and dynamics of infrastructure evolution put tight constraints on our ability to forecast the impacts of particular designs. Our explanation thus rests on two pillars: the contested issues in the public debate illustrate different approaches of sense making and framing among opponents and proponents of the solution. At the level of institutional innovation we can interpret the debate as part of a political process to facilitate or inhibit regulatory changes. The chapter is structured as follows: The next section explains the rationale for innovating medication management in Germany. The third section introduces the theoretical lenses and explains the methodological approach. Section four provides an overview of building blocks of the key ADD proposal and a timeline of events from 2003 - 2013. The fifth section reconstructs the discourse on medication management during the named period.

Incorporating information from social media into decision-making is still difficult though. One reason may be that the prevalent approach to data analysis works bottom-up, which has several limitations. In this paper, we adopt a top-down approach by means of a novel keyword-based method for identifying potentially relevant information in social media data based on structured knowledge of activities undertaken in a domain. The application of the method to the context of humanitarian logistics using four social media datasets shows its capability to identify potentially relevant information via reference tasks and to match identified information with decision-makers&rsquo; activities.

With this paper, we show that reliable customers allow credible FPCs enhancing project success, whereas sophisticated contract provisions do not have this effect. Customer reliability reflects whether the customer uses stable methods and regulations for information processing regarding goal definition, belief generation, and decision-making. Our findings offer managers important insights into how they can design and enact FPCs to manage SDPs successfully. Further, we show how economic theories can enhance understanding of SDP success.",Customer Reliability; Credible Contract; Software Development; Project; Failure Reasons,"['Collaborative Consumption, Ontology, Semantic Web, Sharing Economy, Web Directory']",en
19923921,Do Good Gamers Make Good Students? Sid Meier's Civilization and Performance Prediction,"<em>Civilization</em> is a popular series of turn-based strategy video games. The game is broad, so it confronts players with high complexity. Dealing with this complexity requires good analytical skills, but interpersonal skills are likewise important. These and similar skills are also relevant in the job market, especially for managerial positions, so the question arises whether <em>Civilization</em> can predict business managers&rsquo; performance. To explore this possibility, we conducted a series of multiplayer games with forty business students. While we cannot yet present data related to their job performance, this research-in- progress paper provides first evidence of a significant relationship between game per- formance and academic performance. Our future research will explore the participants&rsquo; analytical and interpersonal skills and how these skills are related to success in the game in order to show whether and how well strategy video games may also predict job performance and, as such, support personnel evaluation and selection.",Civilization; Gamification; Performance prediction; Personnel selection,"['averaged hausdorff distance', ' estimation of distribution algorithm', ' multiobjective optimization']",en
19929146,Analyzing the BBOB Results by Means of Benchmarking Concepts,"We present methods to answer two basic questions that arise when benchmarking opti- mization algorithms. The first one is: which algorithm is the &ldquo;best&rdquo; one? and the second one is: which algorithm should I use for my real-world problem? Both are connected and neither is easy to answer. We present a theoretical framework for designing and analyzing the raw data of such benchmark experiments. This represents a first step in answering the aforementioned questions. The 2009 and 2010 BBOB benchmark results are analyzed by means of this framework and we derive insight regarding the answers to the two questions. Furthermore, we discuss how to properly aggregate rankings from algorithm evaluations on individual problems into a consensus, its theoretical background and which common pitfalls should be avoided. Finally, we address the grouping of test problems into sets with similar optimizer rankings and investigate whether these are reflected by already proposed test problem characteristics, finding that this is not always the case.","['BBOB test set', 'Benchmarking', 'Consensus ranking', 'Evolutionary optimization', 'Exploratory landscape analysis', 'Multidimensional scaling']",,en

This phenomenon describes the fact that it becomes increasingly harder to find relevant information in the sheer amount of information available, basically, the proverbial needle in a haystack. We have previously proposed a solution to this problem in the form of the WiPo framework that does not answer queries solely based on a pre-assembled index, but based on a subject-specific database that is sourced from the Internet, curated by domain experts, and dynamically generated based on vast user input; in addition, it allows a user to take the results offline (”Web in your Pocket”). In this paper, we describe our prototypical implementation thereof: An information platform that delivers high quality information to users, achieved by means of curation. Additionally, we elaborate on use cases, namely movie tourism and search and rescue as well as present some early evaluation results gathered in an interview study.","['Architecture', 'Curation', 'High Quality Information', 'Information Provisioning', 'Web in Your Pocket']",,en

Before making a tool decision, research-ers have to carefully study the features of each device, based on specified requirements, in order to select the most suitable tool. Thus, the tool choice becomes a multi-criteria decision making problem. In this paper, we propose an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based approach for the selection of a NeuroIS tool.

These initiatives are based on the hope that authorities can effectively advise and warn other firms, thereby strengthening overall defense and response to cyberthreats in an economy. If this mechanism works (as assumed in this paper with varying effectiveness), it has consequences on security investments of rational firms. We devise an economic model that distinguishes between investments in detective and preventive controls, and analyze its Nash equilibria. The model suggests that firms subject to mandatory security information sharing 1) over-invest in security breach detection as well as under-invest in breach prevention, and 2), depending on the enforcement practices, may shift investment priorities from detective to preventive controls. We also identify conditions where the regulation increases welfare.","['Detective controls', 'Economics of information security', 'Externalities', 'Game theory', 'Mandatory security information sharing', 'Policy', 'Preventive controls', 'Security investment']","['IT consumerization', ' IT capabilities', ' Business value of IT', ' IT function', ' IT management']",en

Our research, informed by economic theories, compellingly illustrates that among other things changing requirements stems from missing protection on knowledge. In this paper, we present an analysis of knowledge difficult to protect. Both parties must share knowledge during the specification of requirements. However, this business knowledge is an essential intellectual property, and thus needs protection for misuse. We enact a strategy to achieve SDPs success despite these barriers. Our theoretical and empirical analysis also found that SDP success is largely an uncertainty problem between the contractors on the management level, and thus technical-organizational approaches alone are inadequate for achieving success. Based on property rights theory, we introduce two models for protecting knowledge depending on uncertainties. Our findings offer managers important insights into how they can design and enact FPC for effectively manage SDPs. Further, we show how the economic theories can enhance understanding of SDP dynamics and advance the development of a theory of effective control of SDP success.",Software Development Project; Information; Knowledge; Intellectual Property Rights; Property Rights Theory,,en
19943318,Who Are the Rational Actors in Software Development Projects?,"In the field of software development outsourcing and software project management, researchers use concepts from economic theory to describe organizations, groups, teams, and involved people as rational actors. However, they fail to justify these approaches based on an appropriate understanding of the involved social actors&rsquo; status. The question, who really can be described as a rational actor, the organizations, teams, or the individual people, and which kind of rationality they provide, remains open. We have therefore analyzed the social structure of software development projects (SDP) as described in research literature. Based on novel concepts from the field of social philosophy, we have developed a social ontology (SO) of the actors in the context of commercial SDPs. We identified different actors at several levels, with different kinds of rationality. Organizations, departments, and groups may act as rational actors if following well-defined regulations and methods. Actor classification according to the rationality of the actors&rsquo; decision-making will help understand and predict their behavior and thus provide a solid base for the application of economic concepts to software development outsourcing and software project management research.",Group Agents; Collective Actions; Rationality; Software Development Project; Software Development Outsourcing; Software Project Management; Rational Actors,,en
19946892,Designing an Ontology-based Web Directory for the Discovery of Sharing and Collaborative Consumption Platforms,"A vast number of peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and collaborative consumption (SCC) platforms has emerged over the last decade. These platforms allow private individuals to share their physical resources, such as vehicles, spaces, food, clothing, gear and even pets, with other private persons. The large number and diversity of the platforms make it difficult for potential peer-consumers and peer-providers to find an appropriate platform for their demands or offers. This research therefore designs an ontology-based web directory which facilitates an effective discovery of P2P SCC platforms. The paper includes three major contributions. First, we formalize concepts identified in the SCC literature by means of a description language. Second, we develop an ontology that provides a means to purposefully describe the domain of SCC platforms. Third, we describe the design of a web directory that uses the ontology to make discovering P2P SCC platforms more approachable.","['Collaborative Consumption', 'Ontology', 'Semantic Web', 'Sharing Economy', 'Web Directory']",,en

We demonstrate this by replacing the restart heuristic of the IPOP-CMA-ES with the SPO algorithm. Experiments on the BBOB 2010 test cases suggest that the performance is at least competitive while the approach provides more options, e.g. setting more than one parameter at once. Essentially, we argue that SPO is a generalization of the IPOP heuristic and that the distinction between tuning and control is - although often useful - an artificial one.

19970291,The future of experimental research,"In the experimental analysis of metaheuristic methods, two issues are still not sufficiently treated. Firstly, the performance of algorithms depends on their parametrizations-and of the parametrizations of the problem instances. However, these dependencies can be seen as means for understanding an algorithm's behavior. Secondly, the nondeterminism of evolutionary and other metaheuristic methods renders result distributions, not numbers. Based on the experience of several tutorials on the matter, we provide a comprehensive, effective, and very efficient methodology for the design and experimental analysis of metaheuristics such as evolutionary algorithms. We rely on modern statistical techniques for tuning and understanding algorithms from an experimental perspective. Therefore, we make use of the sequential parameter optimization (SPO) method that has been successfully applied as a tuning procedure to numerous heuristics for practical and theoretical optimization problems. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,en

We investigate several search-based approaches to creating good and diverse game content, in particular approaches based on evolution strategies with or without diversity preservation mechanisms, novelty search and random search. The content domain is game levels, more precisely map sketches for strategy games, which are meant to be used as suggestions in the Sentient Sketchbook design tool. Several diversity metrics are possible for this type of content: we investigate tile-based, objective-based and visual impression distance. We find that evolution with diversity preservation mechanisms can produce both good and diverse content, but only when using appropriate distance measures. Reversely, we can draw conclusions about the suitability of these distance measures for the domain from the comparison of diversity preserving versus blind restart evolutionary algorithms.",,,en

Combining scenario simulations with a coevolutionary search of parameter space is an approach that has many attractions. We argue that red teaming applications are sufficiently different from many others where coevolution is used so that specially designed algorithms can bring advantages. We illustrate by presenting a new algorithm that simultaneously evolves strong strategies along with dangerous counter-strategies. We test the new algorithm on two example problems: an abstract problem with some difficult characteristics; and a practical red teaming scenario. Experiments show that the new algorithm is able to solve the abstract problem well, and that it is able to provide useful insights on the red teaming scenario. &copy; 2011 IEEE.",coevolution; red teaming,"['Computer Games', ' Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments', ' Kriging', ' Model-Based Optimization', ' Sequential Parameter Optimization', ' The Open Racing Car Simulator']",en

19970650,Niching foundations: Basin identification on fixed-property generated landscapes,"The performance of niching based or related evolutionary algorithms clearly depends on problem properties as e.g. the number of local optima of a problem. We assume there must be more such properties currently not taken into account and, following from practical experience, suggest two more, namely basin size contrast (BSC), the size relation of the largest and the smallest basin, and global to local optima contrast (GLC), the height relation of the global and an average local optimum. We investigate the effect of these problem properties on the performance of different basin identification methods (as subtasks of niching algorithms), namely nearest-better clustering, detect-multimodal, and Jarvis-Patrick clustering, individually, or in combinations. Employing an existing problem generator that enables complete control and knowledge of basins, instances are generated and validated according to predefined property values and the basin identification performance data is modeled in order to detect similarities that may be interpreted as effects of the stated properties. We also give recommendations concerning usage of basin identification methods in different situations.

In this work, we study the potential of applying such a multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm for feature selection with different objective sets.

19970919,Multi-objective assessment of pre-optimized build orders exemplified for StarCraft 2,"Modern realtime strategy (RTS) games as Star-Craft 2 educe so-called metagames in which the players compete for the best strategies. The metagames of complex RTS games thrive in the absence of apparent dominant strategies, and developers will intervene to adjust the game when such strategies arise in public. However, there are still strategies considered as strong and ones thought of as weak. For the Zerg faction in StarCraft 2, we show how strong strategies can be identified by taking combat strength and economic power into account. The multi-objective perspective enables us to clearly rule out the unfavourable ones of the single optimal build orders and thus selects interesting openings to be tested by real players. By this means, we are e.g. able to explain the success of the recently proposed 7-roach opening. While we demonstrate our approach for StarCraft 2 only, it is of course applicable to other RTS games, given build-order optimization tools exist. &copy; 2013 IEEE.",,"['Detect-multimodal mechanism', ' Hybridization', ' Multimodal evolutionary algorithms', ' Species conservation']",en

On the other hand, virtually identical solution sets can be found which stem from utterly different configurations, hence it is possible to take into account additional decision factors besides the pair of objective functions already optimised. Thus even greater flexibility is possible in the design and planning phase. With the method described in the paper (multiple runs of a standard EMOA combined with a rigorous simulation) we analyse different combinations of conflicting objective functions and based on the respective sets of optimal solutions, different configurations and operation modes are discussed with respect to the variables of the separation task. In a further step we investigate a distillation with regard to key cost factors by means of scenarios and analyse the impact on the solution space and on the attained Pareto sets and discuss to what extent a Pareto set with a suitable choice of objective functions already contains information regarding the sensitivity to key cost factors. We thus show the potential of the described approach in the initial phase of such a project and underline the necessity for optimisation based decision aids for the planning engineer and specifically the benefit gained by the multi-criteria Pareto approach.",Distillation; Evolutionary algorithms; Exergy; Non-sharp splits; Pareto optimisation,"['Computational intelligence', ' Games', ' Tutorial']",en

The process of measuring actually consists of two subsequent steps, a subset selection that only considers 'suitable' points (or just takes all available points of a solution set) and the actual measuring. Known quality indicators often rely on problem knowledge (objective values and/or locations of optima and basins) which makes them unsuitable for real-world applications. Hence, we propose a new subset selection heuristic without such demands, which thereby enables measuring solution sets of single-objective problems, provided a distance metric exists.",archive; indicator; multimodal optimization; multiobjective optimization; performance measuring; solution sets; subset selection,,en
19971193,Making diplomacy bots individual,"Diplomacy is a round-based strategy game with simple rules but a real-time component as players move in parallel. It also emphasizes negotiation between players, which is difficult to realize in a bot but essential to achieve a human-like playing style. In a previous work, we found that in Turing Tests, players mainly use three usual shortcomings of current bot implementations to identify them as computer players, a certain level of playing strength which makes planning necessary, the avoidance of mistakes, that is moves a human most likely would not use, and a meaningful communication. According to previous results, it seems to be especially hard to combine well-playing with a human-like move style. While the communication problem has already been treated successfully at least for short games, currently known CI-based bots do not plan ahead. We present a planning Diplomacy bot which employs the negotiation kernel of an already existing bot and apply our believability measure technique in a new and interesting way. Instead of learning how to minimize the number of bad moves according to a mixture of games of several players-this had proved difficult as different players regard different moves as bad or computer-like-we go a step into the direction of mimicking human player styles by using only saved games of one person each. We thus effectively create a bot which is playing well, including planning, uses basic communication and partly inherits the playing style of a specific human player. The different obtained bots are compared according to playing strength and believability.",,,en
19971283,Looking for alternatives: Optimization of energy supply systems without superstructure,"We investigate different evolutionary algorithm (EA) variants for structural optimization of energy supply systems and compare them with a deterministic optimization approach. The evolutionary algorithms enable structural optimization avoiding to use an underlying superstructure model. As result of the optimization, we are interested in multiple good alternative designs, instead of the one single best solution only. This problem has three levels: On the top level, we need to fix a structure; based on that structure, we then have to select facility sizes; finally, given the structure and equipment sizing, on the bottom level, the equipment operation has to be specified to satisfy given energy demands. In the presented optimization approach, these three levels are addressed simultaneously. We compare EAs acting on the top level (the lower levels are treated by a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver) against an MILP-only-approach and are highly interested in the ability of both methods to deliver multiple different solutions and the time required for performing this task. Neither state-of-the-art EA for numerical optimization nor standard measures or visualizations are applicable to the problem. This lack of experience makes it difficult to understand why different EA variants perform as they do (e.g., for stating how different two structures are), we introduce a distance concept for structures. We therefore introduce a short code, and, based on this short code, a distance measure that is employed for a multidimensional scaling (MDS) based visualization. This is meant as first step towards a better understanding of the problem landscape. The algorithm comparison shows that deterministic optimization has advantages if we need to find the global optimum. In contrast, the presented EA variants reliably find multiple solutions very quickly if the required solution accuracy is relaxed. Furthermore, the proposed distance measure enables visualization revealing interesting problem properties.",,"['algorithm selection', ' bbob test set', ' benchmarking', ' evolutionary optimization', ' exploratory landscape analysis', ' fitness landscape', ' machine learning']",en
19971376,Improved topological niching for real-valued global optimization,"We show how nearest-better clustering, the core component of the NBC-CMA niching evolutionary algorithm, is improved by appyling a second heuristic rule. This leads to enhanced basin identification for higher dimensional (5D to 20D) optimization problems, where the NBC-CMA has previously shown only mediocre performance compared to other niching and global optimization algorithms. The new method is integrated into a niching algorithm (NEA2) and compared to NBC-CMA and BIPOP-CMA-ES via the BBOB benchmarking suite. It performs very well on problems that enable recognizing basins at all with reasonable effort (number of basins not too high, e.g. the Gallagher problems), as expected. Beyond that point, niching is obviously not applicable any more and random restarts as done by the CMA-ES are the method of choice. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,,en
19971467,High-dimensional model-based optimization based on noisy evaluations of computer games,"Most publications on surrogate models have focused either on the prediction quality or on the optimization performance. It is still unclear whether the prediction quality is indeed related to the suitability for optimization. Moreover, most of these studies only employ low-dimensional test cases. There are no results for popular surrogate models, such as kriging, for high-dimensional (n &gt; 10) noisy problems. In this paper, we analyze both aspects by comparing different surrogate models on the noisy 22-dimensional car setup optimization problem, based on both, prediction quality and optimization performance. In order not to favor specific properties of the model, we run two conceptually different modern optimization methods on the surrogate models, CMA-ES and BOBYQA. It appears that kriging and random forests are very good modeling techniques with respect to both, prediction quality and suitability for optimization algorithms. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Computer Games; Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments; Kriging; Model-Based Optimization; Sequential Parameter Optimization; The Open Racing Car Simulator,,en
19971559,Experimental methods for the analysis of optimization algorithms,"In operations research and computer science it is common practice to evaluate the performance of optimization algorithms on the basis of computational results, and the experimental approach should follow accepted principles that guarantee the reliability and reproducibility of results. However, computational experiments differ from those in other sciences, and the last decade has seen considerable methodological research devoted to understanding the particular features of such experiments and assessing the related statistical methods. This book consists of methodological contributions on different scenarios of experimental analysis. The first part overviews the main issues in the experimental analysis of algorithms, and discusses the experimental cycle of algorithm development; the second part treats the characterization by means of statistical distributions of algorithm performance in terms of solution quality, runtime and other measures; and the third part collects advanced methods from experimental design for configuring and tuning algorithms on a specific class of instances with the goal of using the least amount of experimentation. The contributor list includes leading scientists in algorithm design, statistical design, optimization and heuristics, and most chapters provide theoretical background and are enriched with case studies. This book is written for researchers and practitioners in operations research and computer science who wish to improve the experimental assessment of optimization algorithms and, consequently, their design. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

They are applied for three multimodal benchmark functions with various properties and several outputs are considered. A data set with input parameters and metaheuristic outcomes is used for training four surrogate models. They are then each used by a genetic algorithm that is employed for searching the best parameter settings for the initial approaches. The genetic algorithm uses the model outputs as the direct fitness evaluation and only the best found parameter setting is tested within the original metaheuristics. Each model quality is priory evaluated, but they are all subsequently used in the search process to observe how the (in)accuracy influences the final result. Additionally, the genetic algorithm is used for tuning these approaches directly to test if the search conducts to the same parameter set, or at least close to it.",Evolutionary algorithms; Function optimization; Parameter tuning; Surrogate modeling,"['consumer search behaviour', ' consideration set', ' online panel data', ' market structure', ' international and multi-sector research', ' Herfindahl-Hirschman Index', ' clickstream analysis']",en

Although several heuristics and black-box optimization methods are employed, the basic idea of the controller architecture has been to take over many of the mechanisms human racing drivers apply. They learn the track geometry, plan ahead, and wherever necessary, adapt their plans to the current circumstances quickly. Mr. Racer consists of several modules that have partly been adapted and optimized separately, where the final tuning is usually done with respect to a certain racing track during the warmup phase of the TORCS competitions. We also undertake an experimental evaluation that investigates how the controller profits from adding some of the modules to a basic configuration and which modules are most important for reaching the best possible performance. &copy; 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Car racing; Evolutionary computation; Planning controller; TORCS,,en

19971921,Disburdening the species conservation evolutionary algorithm of arguing with radii,"The present paper investigates the hybridization of two well-known multimodal optimization methods, i.e. species conservation and multinational algorithms. The topological species conservation algorithm embraces the vision of the existence of subpopulations around seeds (the best local individuals) and the preservation of these dominating individuals from one generation to another, but detects multimodality by means of the hill-valley mechanism employed by multinational algorithms. The aim is to inherit the strengths of both parent techniques and at the same time overcome their flaws. The species conservation algorithm efficiently keeps track of several good search space regions at once, but is difficult to parametrize without prior problem knowledge. Conversely, the multinational algorithms use many functionevaluations to establish subpopulations, but do not depend onprovided radius parameter values. Experiments with all threealgorithms are made on a wide range of test problems in order toinvestigate their advantages and shortcomings.

Despite calls for systemic approaches, research tends to focus specific obstacles in separation. This article reports on how two publicly funded research projects - both dedicated to developing a specific EV service offering cooperate and work on bundling the two services: ""providing public access to private charging spots"" and ""transferring self-produced energy through public energy grids to other peoples' charging spots"". We argue that via bundling the value proposition of the single services can be elevated. This conceptual research describes use cases, processes, and supportive IT infrastructure needed to bring the service bundle into action. The contribution of this work lies, first, in discussing and outlining the bundling approach, which merges the outcomes of the two research projects. This approach can make a small step towards achieving the socially accepted goal of propelling EVs as a more sustainable means of transport. Second, the paper is novel for that it introduces a set of models, methods, and tools taken from the academic discipline of service science into the strands of research related to EVs.",,,en

Advanced cross-platform approaches such as MD<sup>2</sup>, which is based on model-driven development (MDSD) techniques, are a much more powerful yet less mature choice. We discuss business implications of MDSD for apps and introduce MD<sup>2</sup> as our proposed solution to fulfill typical requirements.

19984974,"Online Consumer Search Behaviour: An International, Cross-Sector Analysis","The Internet has revolutionised access to information and transformed consumer search and buying behaviour. (Hu et al. 2014, Dinner et al. 2014). The consideration set is an important construct in marketing to measure search. Contrary to economic theory (Stigler, 1961), existing Internet studies report relatively small online consideration sets between 2 and 3 (Johnson et al. 2004, Meyer &amp; Stobbe 2010, Holland &amp; Mandry 2013). Our research questions are: 1) Why are online consideration sets relatively small? 2) How do search strategies evolve? 3) What are the differences in search behaviour for constellations of consumers defined by: a) Product and market sectors b) Demographic variables, c) Differences in media use, i.e. computer versus mobile devices, d) Nationality and culture.<br />Methods &amp; Data: Clickstream Analysis, Online Panel Data.Clickstream analysis provides granular data on a very large scale, and can therefore be used to develop research experiments and insights into actual consumer behaviour compared with surveys, which rely on recalled behaviour and statements of future intent.

The laws designate authorities to collect breach reports and advise firms. We devise a principal-agent model to analyze the economic effect of mandatory security breach reporting to authorities. The model assumes that firms (agents) have few incentives to unilaterally report breaches. To enforce the law, regulators (principals) can introduce security audits and sanction noncompliance. However, audits cannot differentiate between concealment and nescience of the agents. Even under optimistic assumptions regarding the effectiveness of mandatory security breach reporting to authorities in reducing individual losses, our model predicts that it may be difficult to adjust the sanction level such that breach notification laws generate social benefit.",Mandatory security breach reporting; interdependent security; information asymmetry; principal-agent theory; security audits,"['Information Management', ' IT/IS Portfolio Management']",en

While the real extent and economic impact is hard to quantify, scientists and officials agree that cybercrime is a huge and still growing problem. A substantial fraction of cybercrime's overall costs to society can be traced to indirect opportunity costs, resulting from unused online services. This paper presents a parsimonious model that builds on technology acceptance research and insights from criminology to identify factors that reduce Internet users' intention to use online services. We hypothesize that avoidance of online banking, online shopping and online social networking is increased by cybercrime victimization and media reports. The effects are mediated by the perceived risk of cybercrime and moderated by the user's confidence online. We test our hypotheses using a structural equation modeling analysis of a representative pan-European sample. Our empirical results confirm the negative impact of perceived risk of cybercrime on the use of all three online service categories and support the role of cybercrime experience as an antecedent of perceived risk of cybercrime. We further show that more confident Internet users perceive less cybercriminal risk and are more likely to use online banking and online shopping, which highlights the importance of consumer education.",Bismuth; Computer crime; Internet; Mathematical model; Media; Online banking; Privacy; Consumer Behavior; Economics of Cybercrime; Online Service Avoidance; Perceived Risk; Structural Equation Modeling; Technology Acceptance Model,,en

An obvious starting point for businesses that wish to make value creation more sustainable is to increase the utilization rates of existing resources. Modern social Internet technology is an effective means by which to achieve IT-enabled sharing services, which make idle resource capacity owned by one entity accessible to others who need them but do not want to own them. Successful sharing services require synchronized participation of providers and users of resources. The antecedents of the participation behavior of providers and users has not been systematically addressed by the extant literature. This article therefore proposes a model that explains and predicts the participation behavior in sharing services. Our search for a theoretical foundation revealed the Theory of Planned Behavior as most appropriate lens, because this theory enables us to integrate provider behavior and user behavior as constituents of participation behavior. The model is novel for that it is the first attempt to study the interdependencies between the behavior types in sharing service participation and for that it includes both general and specific determinants of the participation behavior.",Theory of Planned Behavior; Sharing Economy; Collaborative Consumption; Participation,,en
20018247,A Method for Measuring User Preferences in Information Systems Design Choices ,"Information System Design (ISD) applies information technology to achieve desired ends in organizations and implies many technology choices to be made. A successful design of information systems addresses the different views of all its stakeholders in these decisions. If we consider that sub-part of an IS that is intended to assist in customer processes, a purposeful assessment of the preferences of this anonymous mass is needed. Methods of Human-Centered ISD are not sufficient in that case for that they require too close integration of the subjects; and state of the art preference measurement techniques are likely to be too time-consuming and cognitively challenging if the number of alternatives is large. Building on the Q-Methodology, originally developed to reveal subjectivity in psychology, we suggest a novel method for user preference measurement. We report on a case in which we failed by applying standard techniques for user measurement, but succeeded with Q-Sort. By means of an experiment we subsequently compare the mentioned methods and identify root causes for failure and success we experienced in the case, which for Q-Sort include short execution time, measuring many design choices at one time, satisfaction of the interviewees, and an effective IT support.",Design Choices; Information Systems Design; Psychometric; Preference Determination,,en

A Discussion Paper,"Notwithstanding the substantial overall research efforts in the field of Strategic InformationSystems Planning (SISP), the ""IS strategy"" as the goal and outcome of SISP has received onlylimited research attention to date. In addition, there is considerable evidence that the debateson IS strategy in academia and practice are largely different and independent from each other.This observation motivates us to look into the existing research on IS strategy and itsrelationship to practice in greater detail. Our analysis reveals that academic conceptions of ISstrategy do not seem to have much in common with how IS strategy practitioners interpret theconstruct. Both worlds seem to have coexisted independently alongside one another for a longtime. This divergence leads to a number of problematic outcomes, not least of which is aconsiderable lack of relevance and acceptance of academic research in practice. Based on anintensive study of IS strategy perceptions in both academia and practice, we make suggestionson how IS strategy research should be reinvented in order that it may produce more reliable aswell as practically useful and relevant insights in the face of the challenges of the 21st century.We concentrate these suggestions in four major propositions: (1) Strategy over Strategizing,demanding to develop an understanding of the construct of IS strategy first before focusing onSISP as the process developing it, (2) Strategy in vivo over Strategy in vitro, demanding todevelop a fresh understanding of the construct of IS strategy by conducting research in the fieldinstead of relying on strategy interpretations that are preconfigured by a small number ofprevailing strategy models and theories, (3) Empiricism over Idealism, demanding that intensivefield research on IS strategy should be conducted starting with deep small-scale explorativestudies aiming at new insights instead of large-scale confirmatory surveys that test pre-existinghypotheses, (4) Sustainability over Competitiveness, demanding to relinquish the academicpredilection for research on competitive aspects of IT in favor of issues that are much morerelevant in practice, such as efficiency, reliability, serviceability and sustainability of a company'sIT-based infrastructure.",IS strategy; Strategic Information Systems (SIS); Strategic Information Systems; Planning (SISP); IS strategy contents; IS strategy reasoning; IS strategy practice,"['Individual IS, Individualization, Literature review, Meta-theory']",en

Many of the arguments given for either side are equally correct-because the arguments have been applied to different domains in different situations from specific perspectives-and yet the debate falls short of covering the complexity and dynamics of the ongoing market structure change. The goal of this paper is therefore to develop a more differentiated framework that facilitates the understanding of chances and threats resulting from inter- and cybermediation. The framework suggests to distinguish roles, opportunities and threats for cybermediaries in different situations. While the framework is meant to structure the debate in general, we will focus on public sector procurement to show its application.","['Cybermediary', 'Cybermediation', 'Dis-', 'Electronic procurement', 'Hierarchy', 'Intermediary', 'Market', 'Network', 'Public procurement', 'Re-']","['Combinatorial optimization, Metaheuristics, Multiobjective optimization, Online algorithms, Transportation']",en

20029714,Innovation through BYOD? - The Influence of IT Consumerization on Individual IT Innovation Behavior,"Leveraging the IT innovation capabilities of employees is becoming increasingly feasible in the era of IT consumerization. Consumer IT tools, in form of tablets, smartphones, or social media, are entering organizations and are changing the way employees use technology for work. In this article, we decipher the term IT consumerization in more detail by providing a framework that illustrates the various perspectives of the phenomenon. We then apply the various perspectives in order to propose an IT consumerization framework that juxtaposes consumer IT with enterprise IT in its ability to lead to individual IT innovation behaviors. Using data from 486 European employees that work for large-sized companies, we are able to infer that consumer IT and the permission to use privately owned IT exert positive effects on employees' innovation behaviors. An examination of the various perspectives supports the assumption of science and practice that BYOD strategies and the diffusion of consumer IT within organizations are beneficial for innovation. The results provide a first step in theorizing about the innovative power of IT consumerization.",IT consumerization; BYOD; CYOD; Individual innovation; Employee-driven innovation; Smartphones; Tablets,"['Clustering methods, Customer-oriented supply chain segmentation, Decision support systems, K-Means, Self organizing maps']",en
20029792,The Intensified Blurring of Boundaries between Work and Private Life through IT Consumerization,"Consumer technologies have intensified the blurring between work and private spaces. For instance, employees increasingly use privately owned devices for work or company provided devices for private tasks. By means of a multiple case study in four organisations, we investigate the current use of consumer IT in organisations in relation to the increased blurring between work and private life. With regard to boundary theory, we are able to identify six technology-related aspects that describe the intensifying role of IT consumerisation in terms of blurring boundaries. Whether people strive for work-life integration or segmentation, they often experience conflicts in realising their individual preference. However, it seems that IT consumerisation further moved the standard for work-life blurring towards integration rather than segmentation. The number of identified conflicts suggests that there is still a lot of potential for software vendors and user companies to make the management of work and private life spaces more feasible. More specifically, there is a need for solutions that better target individual preferences towards work-life blurring. Our study sheds further light on both increasing chances and challenges that consumer technology puts on employees and organisations.",,,en
20029868,Unraveling the Effect of Personal Innovativeness on Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) Intention - The Role of Perceptions towards Enterprise-Provided and Privately-Owned Technologies,"Consumerization of information technology (IT) refers to consumer technologies finding their way into enterprises. In this context, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) describes the phenomenon of privately-owned mobile devices being brought into organizations. While research on the general topic is scarce, initial studies have identified personal innovativeness in IT as one important driver for this behavior. However, the reasons why innovative people are more likely to use their privately-owned devices for work remain largely undiscovered. This study argues that technology acceptance factors with respect to both the enterprise-provided as well as the privately-owned mobile devices are important media-tors. Moreover, a model using perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use as mediators is derived. The model's underlying hypotheses are then tested using data from a quantitative survey in Germany. The results show that beliefs towards the ease of use of both the enterprise-provided as well as the privately owned mobile IT mediate the relationship between personal innovativeness in IT and BYOD intention. The findings are discussed with respect to implications for theory and practice and an out-look is given on potential future research.",,"['Evolutionary algorithms, Multi-objective optimization, Vehicle routing']",en
20029946,Are You Ready to Lose Control? - A Theory on the Role of Trust and Risk Perception on Bring-Your-Own-Device Policy and Information System Service Quality,"IT consumerization or bring-your-own-device (BYOD) behavior, i.e., the use of private devices within organizational boundaries, is steadily increasing. Despite potential benefits, organizations are strug-gling to keep up with this development since a variety of risks, uncertainties, and potential costs are related to the use of private devices within the enterprise. Potential negative consequences are securi-ty breaches due to employees' lack of security measures or increasing coordination efforts for the IT department. While plenty of practitioner literature already exists, there is still a lack of scientific re-search. Especially theoretical foundations are lacking regarding organizations' decision processes underlying the implementation of BYOD policies, outcomes such as IS service quality, and the role of trust as an alternative to organizational and technical control mechanisms to minimize the risks asso-ciated with BYOD. Based on organizational trust literature, BYOD studies, and argumentations, we conclude a model of the influence of trust and risk perception on BYOD policies and outcomes. As a next step, we suggest a quantitative survey among Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to test the model. We conclude our study by outlining potential contributions to theory by integrating theories on organ-izational trust, IT risks, and IS service quality in the context of BYOD.",,"['Parameter dependent multi-objective optimization', ' Stochastic local search', ' Evolutionary algorithms']",en
20030022,Conceptualizing Individualization in Information Systems - A Literature Review,"Driven by advances in information and communication technology, end-users nowadays operate extensive information systems to support all kinds of private and professional activities. Previous IS research has coined various terms to refer to this rather new phenomenon. Some scholars call it individualization in IS, others refer to it as consumerization of IT. While scholars still struggle to agree on a common conceptualization and terminology, it is clear that particular aspects of this new phenomenon have already been addressed by previous work on technology acceptance, satisfaction or technology diffusion. However, these previous findings do not form a distinct and integrated body of knowledge, because no one has associated them with the phenomenon of individualization yet. In order to address this gap, we suggest an integrated, yet generic conceptualization of individualization in form of a meta-theory. Based on the key entities and relations of the meta-theory, we conduct a structured literature review to identify pre-existing contributions of IS research, which help to understand the phenomenon of individualization in IS better. Furthermore, we analyze the identified literature for gaps in understanding the phenomenon and outline future research opportunities.","['Individual IS', 'Individualization', 'Literature review', 'Meta-theory']","['Decision Support Systems (DSS)', ' Software Architecture', ' Electric Vehicles', ' Electric Vehicle Batteries', ' Traction Batteries', ' Reuse', ' Service Science', ' Sustainability']",en
20030982,Learning Feature-Parameter Mappings for Parameter Tuning via the Profile Expected Improvement,"The majority of algorithms can be controlled or adjusted by parameters. Their values can substantially affect the algorithms' performance. Since the manual exploration of the parameter space is tedious - even for few parameters - several automatic procedures for parameter tuning have been proposed. Recent approaches also take into account some characteristic properties of the problem instances, frequently termed instance features. Our contribution is the proposal of a novel concept for feature-based algorithm parameter tuning, which applies an approximating surrogate model for learning the continuous feature-parameter mapping. To accomplish this, we learn a joint model of the algorithm performance based on both the algorithm parameters and the instance features. The required data is gathered using a recently proposed acquisition function for model refinement in surrogate-based optimization: the profile expected improvement. This function provides an avenue for maximizing the information required for the feature-parameter mapping, i.e., the mapping from instance features to the corresponding optimal algorithm parameters. The approach is validated by applying the tuner to exemplary evolutionary algorithms and problems, for which theoretically grounded or heuristically determined feature-parameter mappings are available.","['Evolutionary algorithms', 'Model-based optimization', 'Parameter tuning']","['Electric Vehicle Battery (EVB)', ' Lemon Market Theory', ' Principal Agent Problem', ' Transaction Cost Analysis', ' Decision Support System', ' Electronic Marketplace']",en
20031616,A Gender Perspective on Business Process Management Competences Offered on Professional Online Social Networks,"While Business Process Management (BPM) originally strongly focused on Information Technology as a key factor driving the efficiency and effectiveness of organisational processes, there is a growing consensus that BPM represents a holistic management approach that also takes factors like corporate governance, human capital and organisational culture into account. Focusing on human capital, our exploratory study examines competences supplied in the BPM field and how far they represent the holistic nature of BPM. Further, our study tries to understand, whether the BPM field, which is traditionally perceived as very technical, is not immune to the challenge of female underrepresentation. Addressing underrepresentation of women in BPM would help to mitigate the existing competence shortage in the field that stems from the lack of qualified BPM professionals. Thus, we take a gender perspective in analysing 10,405 BPM-related LinkedIn profiles using a text mining technique called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). We identify 12 distinct categories of competences supplied by BPM professionals, which, in general, reflect the interdisciplinary nature of BPM, ranging from technical to managerial and domain-specific competences. Analysis of the gender distribution shows that women are underrepresented among the BPM professionals under study and, in particular, among those representing most of the identified categories of competences.",business process management; competence analysis; LSA; gender diversity; BPM workforce,,en

20052082,Evaluation of a Multi-Objective EA on Benchmark Instances for Dynamic Routing of a Vehicle,"We evaluate the performance of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm on a class of dynamic routing problems with a single vehicle. In particular we focus on relating algorithmic performance to the most prominent characteristics of problem instances. The routing problem considers two types of customers: mandatory customers must be visited whereas optional customers do not necessarily have to be visited. Moreover, mandatory customers are known prior to the start of the tour whereas optional customers request for service at later points in time with the vehicle already being on its way. The multi-objective optimization problem then results as maximizing the number of visited customers while simultaneously minimizing total travel time. As an a-posteriori evaluation tool, the evolutionary algorithm aims at approximating the related Pareto set for specifically designed benchmarking instances differing in terms of number of customers, geographical layout, fraction of mandatory customers, and request times of optional customers. Conceptional and experimental comparisons to online heuristic procedures are provided.","['Combinatorial optimization', 'Metaheuristics', 'Multiobjective optimization', 'Online algorithms', 'Transportation']",,en

The particular feature of the decision rules is that they aim at more efficient routing of the vehicle by deliberately introducing vehicle idle times. Our goal is to provide both routing information system providers and supply chain operators with criteria for application of these policies in practice. The main characteristic of the class of routing problems considered is that part of the customer requests are uncertain, i.e., that part of the requests are not known in advance, but occur only while the service vehicle already is en route. In order to derive criteria for successful application of the decision rules in practice, we compare the rules by means of computational experiments with respect to a broad variety of instances of the considered class of routing problems. In particular we derive guidelines by varying service region, time horizon and customer request behavior. Eventually, we assess the rules' performance by comparing them with ideal a posteriori solutions.","['Decision Rules', 'Dynamic Vehicle Routing', 'Mathematical Optimization.', 'Uncertain Service Requests']","['algorithmic skeletons', ' parallel programming', ' farm']",en

BMSs are often designed for simplicity and cost efficiency, storing few crucial data on the condition of batteries. With an increasing trend to reuse batteries, BMSs face a need to implement additional functionality to support decision-making tasks. This functionality requires rich data on the structure, usage history, and condition of a battery that is not supported by current BMS type series. Based on expert interviews and document analyses, we sketch a design theory for implementing BMSs that supply the data required for making decisions on how to best reuse battery systems.","['Battery management system', 'Condition monitoring', 'Decision support system', 'Design theory', 'Embedded system']","['model-driven software development', ' business apps', ' cross-platform']",en
20070823,Application and Evaluation of Multi-criteria Clustering Algorithms for Customer-Oriented Supply Chain Segmentation,"Due to an ever increasing complexity, modern supply chains have to make use of Decision Support Systems to focus on the one hand on cost savings and on the other hand on a high customer orientation. This is especially difficult due to different service and costs expectations that have to be taken into account jointly to fulfill the customer expectations more precisely. While the need for a differentiated service fulfillment is generally acknowledged, little research exists to date addressing how an organization can identify different economical and logistical viable groups of a customer base for different logistical problem statements. Therefore, this paper seeks to enhance the knowledge in this area by the application and evaluation of a relative new data clustering algorithm based on Self Organizing Maps and comparing it to a standard data clustering algorithm based on the K-Means algorithm in the context of the research domain of supply chain segmentation.","['Clustering methods', 'Customer-oriented supply chain segmentation', 'Decision support systems', 'K-Means', 'Self organizing maps']",,en

20071054,Multi-Objective Analysis of Approaches to Dynamic Routing Of a Vehicle,"We consider a routing problem for a single vehicle serving customer locations in the course of time. A subset of these customers must necessarily be served, while the complement of this subset contains dynamic customers which request for service over time, and which do not necessarily need to be served. The decision maker&rsquo;s conflicting goals are serving as many customers as possible as well as minimizing total travel distance. We solve this bi-objective problem with an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm in order to provide an a-posteriori evaluation tool for enabling decision makers to assess the single-objective solution strategies that they actually use in real-time. We present the modifications to be applied to the evolutionary multi-objective algorithm NSGA2 in order to solve the routing problem, we describe a number of real-time single-objective solution strategies, and we finally use the gained efficient trade-off solutions of NSGA2 to exemplarily evaluate the real-time strategies. Our results show that the evolutionary multi-objective approach is well-suited to generate benchmarks for assessing dynamic heuristic strategies.

The new insights may be helpful for the design of novel stochastic search algorithms such as specialized evolutionary approaches. The discussion in particular indicates that it might be beneficial to integrate the set of external parameters directly into the search instead of computing projections of the solution sets separately by fixing the value of the external parameter.,Parameter dependent multi-objective optimization; Stochastic local search; Evolutionary algorithms,,en

20117712,A Market for Trading Used Electric Vehicle Batteries - Theoretical Foundations and Information Systems,"Various automotive companies have demonstrated that used electric vehicle batteries (EVBs), after having been removed from electric vehicles (EVs) due to insufficient capacity or power, can still be repurposed as energy storage for stationary applications. If predictions on the diffusion of EVs prove true, a large amount of used EVBs will be available for repurposing until the end of this decade. As yet, the fundamental economic properties of a market for used EVBs are unexplored. Additionally, the role of information systems as enablers for second life business models and tools for trading used EVBs has not been investigated. Inspired by seminal economic theories and based on reviewing the market for used automotive parts, we offer a first conceptualization of three forms such a market might take, along with their economic properties and stakeholders. We subject these market forms to a conceptual transaction cost analysis and an empirical inquiry based on semi-structured interviews. We find that a market for used EVBs will likely emerge as an intermediary-based market that is supported by automobile companies. Against this backdrop, decision support systems seem to be a more suitable class of information systems than electronic marketplaces to enable the trading of used EVBs.",Electric Vehicle Battery (EVB); Lemon Market Theory; Principal Agent Problem; Transaction Cost Analysis; Decision Support System; Electronic Marketplace,"['2-opt, Classification, Feature Selection, MARS, TSP']",en

They provide scalable performance yet introducing complex and low-level programming models for shared and distributed memory programming. Thus, fully exploiting the potential of shared and distributed memory parallelization can be a tedious and error-prone task: programmers must take care of low-level threading and communication (e.g. message passing) details.

20131849,Robust Parameter Setting of Supply Chain Flexibility Measures Using Distributed Evolutionary Computing,"Today's supply chains are challenged by volatile customer demand. Demand for a wider product choice, shortened product lifecycle and expected high availability add to the already complex, dynamic and uncertain business environment. Operating under such conditions poses difficulties to a company to uphold their supply chain's performance. Flexibility is required to be able to adapt to unanticipated changes in supply or demand and to diminish their repercussions. Miscellaneous flexibility measures, e.g. safety stocks or flexible capacities, are widespread used to compensate demand fluctuations. The selected measures&rsquo; parameters, e.g. range of flexible capacity, must be configured ahead of the implementation in practice. The flexibility parameters determine the scope of action a flexibility measure enables.

An Exploration of Alternate Explanations for BPM Capability Development,"Business process management (BPM) is a topic that has received immense attention in information systems research and practice. While the existing literature comprehensively covers BPM methods, techniques, and tools, the development of BPM capability in organizations remains under-researched. Existing studies mainly present maturity models with generic sequences of distinct stages that provide a rather simplistic perspective on BPM capability progress. Taking a process theory view and drawing from organizational change literature, we elaborate on alternate templates for explaining BPM capability development. By revisiting two case studies on BPM capability development, we analyze the explanatory power of four basic theories of capability development and thus advance existing approaches to explain BPM capability progress. Our analysis shows the general applicability of these theories and points to particular advantages, disadvantages, and application conditions. Using the four basic theories as alternate templates, we also offer a much more-detailed explanation of the mechanisms behind the episodes of BPM capability progress that we observed in the two case studies. In particular, the different theoretical templates allow one to better understand the influence of internal and external contexts on BPM capability progress.","['Business Process Management', 'Capability Development', 'Organizational Change', 'Process Theory']","['Data marketplaces, Data marketplaces survey, Data trading']",en
20186751,Information Categories for Infrastructure and Logistic Resource Assessments in Humanitarian Logistics,"Humanitarian logistics assessment aims at quickly gathering accurate information about a disaster-affected area. This includes information about the infrastructure and logistic resources which are required to execute a humanitarian operation. Assessment thus provides a decision basis, e.g. to plan aid deliveries. Despite its relevance, assessment has hardly been researched. This paper structures practical knowledge and makes it accessible to the research community. Accordingly, it is based on documents from practice, exploring assessment tools and guidelines of humanitarian aid organizations regarding infrastructure and logistic resources. Furthermore, it structures the knowledge contained in them. Inductive Category Development, a qualitative research approach, is used to split the documents into comparable information fragments. On that foundation, we consider three assessment phases: preparedness, rapid response and on-going response. We give an example to illustrate which information to assess during each phase and explain how the assessments in these phases are connected. The findings provide a foundation for developing comprehensive theories on infrastructure and logistic resource assessments, as well as impulses for humanitarian aid organizations to standardize their assessment tools. The standardization can increase the speed of assessment and facilitates information sharing between organizations.",Humanitarian logistics; Assessment; Infrastructure and logistic resource assessment; Information requirements; Inductive category development,"['Activity, Community, Crowdfunding, Project development, Success indicators']",en
20193551,Do good things and talk about them: A Theory of Academics Usage of Enterprise Social Networks for Impression Management Tactics,"Enterprise social networks provide benefits especially for knowledge-intensive work as they enable communication, collaboration and knowledge exchange. These platforms should therefore lead to increased adoption and use by knowledge-intensive workers such as consultants or indeed researchers. Our interest is in ascertaining whether scientific researchers use enterprise social networks as part of their work practices. This focus is motivated by an apparent schism between a need for researchers to exchange knowledge and profile themselves, and the aversion to sharing breakthrough ideas and joining in an ever-increasing publishing and marketing game. We draw on research on academic work practices and impression management to develop a model of academics' ESN usage for impression management tactics. We describe important constructs of our model, offer strategies for their operationalization and give an outlook to our ongoing empirical study of the use of an ESN platform by 20 schools across six faculties at an Australian university.",Enterprise Social Networks; Impression Management; Use Behavior; Academic Work Practices; Knowledge Exchange,,en

Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the solvers exhibit complementary performance across a diverse set of instances, and the potential for improving the state of the art by selecting between them is significant. Using TSP features from the literature as well as a set of novel features, we show that we can capitalise on this potential by building an efficient selector that achieves significant performance improvements in practice. Our selectors represent a significant improvement in the state-of-the-art in inexact TSP solving, and hence in the ability to find optimal solutions (without proof of optimality) for challenging TSP instances in practice.",,,en
20270971,Longitudinal Evaluation of ICT Intervention Programs for Girls,"Intervention programs creating awareness among girls about the wide range of career opportunities in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) field are conducted in many countries to tackle the problem of female under-representation in ICT. The long-term effects of these programs, however, are rarely evaluated which hinders the understanding of how they could be improved, their value and success factors. The goal of this study is, therefore, to investigate the longitudinal influence of one such program held biennially in Australia since 2006, by analysing survey data both quantitatively and qualitatively (n = 153). The results show that continuous study of an ICT subject at school by girls positively influences both their intention to choose a career in ICT and the actual choice of ICT as a university major. Moreover, the attitude towards the intervention program has a weak, but significant positive effect on the decision to study ICT at school.",Intervention programs; longitudinal evaluation; girls and ICT; gender diversity,"['Social Recommendation Agents', ' Social Presence', ' Trust']",en

20343869,Designing Electronic Feedback - Analyzing the Effects of Social Presence on Perceived Feedback Usefulness,"Feedback interventions, i.e. actions taken by (an) external agent(s) to provide information regarding one's task performance, are an important element in motivating and raising performance. Especially the perceived feedback usefulness determines its positive effects. In today's digitalized world, feedback is more often given electronically, i.e. computer-mediated or even automated by computer systems. Those feedback interventions' effect on perceptions resulting from the difference of communication media is essentially considered by the concept of social presence. However, Information Systems (IS) research lacks a structured evaluation of possible design choices of feedback media, their influence on social presence and subsequent effect on the perceived feedback usefulness. To close this research gap, we conduct a laboratory experiment with 43 participants in which we analyze six different design choices for feedback media. We applied a 2x3 experimental design covering the feedback source (human, non-human feedback) and media richness (text, audio, and video). We show that social presence directly and mediated by the perceived trustworthiness of feedback on simple IT-based tasks impacts perceived feedback usefulness. Our study concludes by outlining opportunities for future research and practical implications for human and non-human (i.e. automated) feedback.",Electronic Feedback; Automated Feedback; Perceived Usefulness; Social Presence Theory,"['Incomplete Information', ' Principal-Agent Approach', ' Credible Contract', ' Software Development Project', ' Failure Reasons']",en

With this slogan Apple suggests that there is app out there for many uses and indeed for every circumstance within our everyday life. However, there is a lack of knowledge of what business models prevail in successfully developing and capitalizing an app. This paper aims to investigate prevalent business models. For this purpose, approximately 300 successful apps from the Apple App Store were analysed. Moreover, 10 semi-structured interviews were carried out with app developers who have successfully placed an app within the top charts of the Apple App Store. It is notable that content-driven apps entertaining users in combination with a &lsquo;freemium' or &lsquo;in-app' revenue model dominate the Apple app market.

20344856,“Do you trust me?” – A Structured Evaluation of Trust and Social Recommendation Agents,"Recommender systems are considered as useful software that helps users in screening and evaluating products. The fact that users do not know how these systems make decisions leads to an information asymmetry. Thus, users need to trust if they want to take over systems' recommendations. Applying social interfaces has been suggested as helpful extensions of recommender systems to increase trust. These are called (Social) Recommendation Agents. While many articles and implementations can be found in the field of e-commerce, we believe that Recommendation Agents can be applied to other contexts, too. However, a structured evaluation of contexts and design dimensions for Recommendation Agents is lacking. In this study, first, we give an overview of design dimensions for Recommendation Agents. Second, we explore previous research on trust and Recommendation Agents by means of a structured literature review. Finally, based on the resulting overview, we highlight three major areas for future research.",Social Recommendation Agents; Social Presence; Trust,"['social media', ' crises communication', ' emergency']",en
20344933,Design Principles for a Social Question and Answers Site: Enabling User-to-User Support in Organizations,"The adoption of consumer technology in organizations, termed as IT consumerization, alters the IT infrastructure of many organizations. Letting employees decide which IT tools to use for their work increases the complexity of the organizational IT landscape and immediately raises the question how to provide adequate support given the multitude of technologies. Bring-Your-Own-Device advocates argue that employees can provide IT support on their own. An established concept to provide user-to-user support are social questions &amp; answers sites (SQA). While such community sites are perfectly suited for exploratory problem solving, they lack however suitability to help solving specific problems subject to a specific organization. Moreover, receiving fast ad-hoc help in SQA is rather unlikely, as communication is always indirect and experts to solve the problem are unknown beforehand. The work presented in this paper explores key design characteristics of SQA sites in organizations that overcome the shortcoming of public SQA sites. Based on existing IS literature, we identify four kernel theories that are relevant for SQA sites in organizations and derive meta-requirements from them. In a next step, we analyze five public SQA sites to identify common design principles of SQA sites that are already applied. The main part of our analysis matches the identified design principles with the formulated meta-requirements to address potential gaps with respect to an enterprise environment. We conclude our research with the suggestion of additional design principles for SQA sites that account for their application in an organizational context.",IT Consumerization; BYOD; user-to-user support; social questions and answers sites,"['Social Media', ' Hierarchy', ' network emergence', ' Yammer']",en

It is shown that 40% of the German online population only conduct direct research, 35% only use an online travel agent, and that 25% use a combination of both methods. The online consideration set based on direct research is 2.58. The interaction effect from using a combination of direct research and online travel agents is analysed using set theory.

20351094,"Bitcoin: Economics, Technology, and Governance","Bitcoin is an online communication protocol that facilitates the use of a virtual currency, including electronic payments. Bitcoin's rules were designed by engineers with no apparent influence from lawyers or regulators. Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers. It includes mechanisms to reward honest participation, to bootstrap acceptance by early adopters, and to guard against concentrations of power. Bitcoin's design allows for irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation over time, and a public transaction history. Anyone can create a Bitcoin account, without charge and without any centralized vetting procedure-or even a requirement to provide a real name. Collectively, these rules yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment-though as we discuss, all these benefits face important limits. Bitcoin is of interest to economists as a virtual currency with potential to disrupt existing payment systems and perhaps even monetary systems. This article presents the platform's design principles and properties for a nontechnical audience; reviews its past, present, and future uses; and points out risks and regulatory issues as Bitcoin interacts with the conventional financial system and the real economy.",,"['Media synchronicity theory', ' context', ' knowledge worker', ' mobile', ' media choice']",en

These models mostly describe the customer as the principal, whereas the supplier is the agent. Our study shows, that regarding gaps in software requirement specifications, the supplier is in a principal situation, and the customer plays the role of an agent. Specifications are incomplete due to systematical reasons. Therefore, the customer must work on closing the gaps during the design and development phase of the project. From this, behavioral uncertainties arise. An empirical study supports our theoretical argument.

In our study, we suggest switching to the contracting level, describing the interaction of the involved organizations in terms of game theory. Organizations pursue economic targets. As we will show, the customer and the supplier are in a dilemma situation regarding the effort for closing the gaps in the requirement specifications. This results in a high risk for the quality of the software system. In support of our theoretical argument, we carried out an empirical investigation that shows that gaps in requirements and conflicts in the project exist of nearly every project. The most commonly used contract model is a fixed-price contract. From our model, we can derive suggestions for the contract design of software development projects as well as for the cooperation behavior during the project.",Dilemma structures; Failure; Incomplete contract; Information asymmetry; Outsourcing; Software development project,"['Social Media', ' Bundetagswahl', ' Politik', ' Twitter', ' Blogs']",en

How do properties of the social media communication network determine EMA and other network role relations and the overall network configuration? We argue that trust (-worthiness) is a central non-relational attribute of an EMA role which is based on perceptions of EMA integrity and which influences role relationships within the social network. As EMAs are also responsible for taking action to protect the community in times of such an extreme event, we also argue that &ldquo;swift trust&rdquo; is built within EMA roles. EMA roles are also reinforced by the non-relational role attribute of communication quality that reflects message authenticity, in this case &ldquo;transparent and understandable&rdquo; communications that are expected of an EMA.",social media; crises communication; emergency,"['BYOD, IT consumerization, Mobile IT, Work-to-life conflict']",en
20378788,From Top to Bottom: Investigating the Changing Role of Hierarchy and Influence in Enterprise Social Networks,"Social media, such as social networking platforms, increasingly gain importance in enterprise contexts. Enterprise Social Networking (ESN) is often associated with improved communication, information-sharing and problem-solving. At the same time, ESN has been argued to diminish the role of formal influence in that users increasingly derive authority from their contributions to the network rather than from their position in the organisational hierarchy. Others argue that ESN will diminish influence outright by producing more democratic and inclusive communication structures. Yet, these assertions remain largely un-explored empirically so far. Against this background, we explore the influence of both a user&rsquo;s position in the organisation&rsquo;s hierarchy and a user&rsquo;s contributions to the network on the ability to elicit responses from other ESN users. We draw on a unique data set of more than 110,000 messages collected from the ESN platform Yammer at Deloitte Australia. While we find evidence for both kinds of influence, our data also reveals that informal influence has a stronger effect and that, as the ESN community matures over time, communication structures become indeed more inclusive and balanced across hierarchical levels. We contribute a set of propositions that theorise the ways in which influence and communication pattern are shaped during the process of ESN emergence. Our results further underline the potentials of ESN in improving organic, user-driven communication and knowledge sharing within firms.",Social Media; Hierarchy; network emergence; Yammer,"['Freedom of choice, IT consumerization, Job performance, Ownership']",en

A common way to identify weaknesses is to analyze process models. While this has traditionally been done manually, recent work proposes using automatic model query approaches promising time and money savings. Query approaches take (weakness) patterns as input and return all process model subsections that match these patterns, hence may be subject to weaknesses. Although numerous model query approaches have been developed, collections of weaknesses do virtually not exist. To exploit the benefits of model querying, a weakness collection would be highly desirable. In this paper, we provide a first version of a weakness pattern collection, which we identified in an empirical study on several hundreds of weakness-afflicted process models and assess its usefulness through applying it to another process model collection.",Business Process Improvement; Business Process Modelling; Model Querying; Process Patterns; Business Process Weakness Detection,,en

20394937,A Domain-Specific Modeling Language for Electric Vehicle Batteries,"Electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) are crucial components of electric vehicles (EVs). They also account for a major share of the initial prices of EVs, inhibiting the diffusion of green mobility solutions. After having been removed from the vehicles due to an increased internal resistance or an insufficient capacity to store energy, EVBs may be recycled, refabricated, or reused to comply with legal regulations and to generate additional business returns. Making an informed decision on the further application of a used EVB presupposes in-depth product data, operating instructions, and status data on the battery. In this paper, a domain-specific modeling language is designed to specify the data structures required to describe EVBs. In the spirit of design research, the modeling language's validity and utility are demonstrated by modeling a typical EVB. In future research, the modeling language's meta-model can be extended and made configurable to inform various afterlife scenarios.",,"['digital audio forensics, electrical network frequency, mobile devices, noise']",en

In contrast to other technology implementations where management follows an application view, we present a case where management introduces RTC as an infrastructure, i.e. it looks at a complex ensemble of technology artifacts which are used by heterogeneous users in a multitude of ways, many of whom are unforeseen. The paper uses a framework of managerial tasks and responsibilities to explain the balancing act between managerial dictum on the one side and providing space for experimentation and organizational learning on the other side. The organizational design shows a high level of management sensitivity to the complementarity principles of organizational and technical choices. The case further provides rich insights into the processes of rule setting and organizational embedding of RTC.

This research article addresses the question: How does context influence the choice of communication channels of mobile knowledge workers? An explorative research approach is used to collect and analyse 418 communication incidents, which were initiated by mobile knowledge workers.

Public administration cannot profit from synergy effects which could be gained by a shared effort for developing these information - although a holistic approach for an integrated information management should be the goal of strategy. The aim of this paper is to combine and integrate data and information from the information domains of services, processes and forms from the public sector domain and provide a holistic approach to make them usable for information managers in the field. To this end, we identify the essential relationships and effects of these information domains on the administrative action. We develop a framework based on the information needs outside of the administration (citizens and private sector) and within the administration, which represents content and interaction.

20411126,Dual Use of Mobile IT and  Work-to-Life Conflict in the Context of IT Consumerization,"Using the same technologies for both work and private life is an intensifying phenomenon. Mostly driven by the availability of consumer IT in the marketplace, individuals - more often than not - are tempted to use privately-owned IT rather than enterprise IT in order to get their job done. However, this dual-use of technologies comes at a price. It intensifies the blurring of the boundaries between work and private life - a development in stark contrast to the widely spread desire of employees to segment more clearly between their two lives. If employees cannot follow their segmentation preference, it is proposed that this misfit will result in work-to-life conflict (WtLC). This paper investigates the relationship between organizational encouragement for dual use and WtLC. Via a quantitative survey, we find a significant relationship between the two concepts. In line with boundary theory, the effect is stronger for people that strive for work-life segmentation.","['BYOD', 'IT consumerization', 'Mobile IT', 'Work-to-life conflict']","['Change Management', ' Business Process Modeling Tool', ' Enterprise Resource Planning']",en
20411201,Exploring the Relationship between IT Consumerization and Job Performance: A theoretical framework for future research,"The consumerization of information technology (IT) refers to consumer IT resources, such as laptops, smartphones, social media, or cloud storage, that are used for business purposes. The topic has engendered an ongoing debate among practitioners. However, a scientific approach has yet to be developed to understand the effects of IT consumerization on individual performance in the workplace. In this paper, we conduct an inductive empirical study on pilot projects in an industrial and a public sector organization. From these data, we derive key concepts and develop a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the relationship between IT consumerization and job performance. In particular, ownership and freedom of choice are interesting concepts to provide insights beyond what has already been investigated in previous research on IT-related job performance. Our findings lay the foundation for developing a substantive theory that is independent of our area of enquiry. Moreover, they show numerous connections to the body of information systems literature that sharpen our construct definitions and raise the theoretical level of the results. We outline potential avenues for future research on IT consumerization based on our study’s contributions.","['Freedom of choice', 'IT consumerization', 'Job performance', 'Ownership']","['Sustainability', ' Information Systems', ' ICT', ' Definition', ' Review']",en

This paper extends the weighted stego-image (WS) steganalysis method to detect stego images produced from covers that exhibit traces of color filter array (CFA) interpolation, which is common for images acquired with digital cameras. The approach combines techniques of CFA forensics with state-of-the-art WS steganalysis. Empirical results from large datasets indicate significant increases in detection performance, in particular for small payloads.

A massive experimental test setup benchmarks our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods under various perspectives, examining both pixel-level localization and image-level detection performance. By taking signal characteristics into account and distinguishing between 'textured' and 'smooth' duplicated regions, we find that the proposed method outperforms prior art in particular when duplicated regions are smooth.

State-of-the-Art and Proposals for an Integrative Definition of Sustainability in Information Systems,"Degradation of the natural environment is presently attracting significant attention among the Information Systems (IS) academic community. Consequently, the subject of sustainability continues to gain a foothold in the mainstream of IS research. However, as the body of research grows, the exact meaning of sustainability is increasingly becoming a source of uncertainty. The absence of a clear definition of sustainability in the IS domain poses a challenge for operationalizing the concept and limits the methodological viability of research in the field. By means of a systematic literature review, this paper identifies problems related to diverging or even a complete absence of sustainability definitions in the relevant IS literature. The results reveal what constitutes a sound definition of sustainability as a characteristic of a stakeholder activity and a new perspective for Information Systems research on sustainability, in which an activity becomes a quantum of sustainability analysis.

20449227,Promoting Port Resiliency,"The two relatively new fields&mdash;resiliency and preparedness&mdash;increasingly show the need to improve the resiliency and preparedness of both seaports and airports. One major problem is the unwillingness of seaports and airports&mdash;ports in general&mdash;to invest in the redundancy, robustness, and flexibility/agility measures that lead to resiliency. Economic pressures from competition among ports and from the power of tenants and users to force ports to minimize capital and operating costs often make it unattractive for a port to invest in the extra planning, training, drilling, exercising, and equipment to enhance resiliency. In addition, port managers are often preoccupied with normal operations and hesitant to consider &ldquo;worst case&rdquo; scenarios with a high impact but low probability. Such a situation creates a lack of motivation on the part of ports to invest in resiliency and a lack of motivation of their tenants and users to support these kinds of investment. This paper proposes a novel way to motivate port owners and operators and encourage their tenants and users to support resiliency efforts. The basic concept is to create a port resiliency certification program with clear, explicit standards, procedures, and documentation that the insurance and reinsurance industry can recognize as an effective strategy for risk reduction and loss reduction, a strategy that is worthy of reward through lowered premiums or preferred treatment on reimbursements for losses. This paper proposes a step-by-step process to create an airport resiliency certification program.

Due to the need for accuracy and timeliness, the information must be updated and related to the real variables of the affected area. In this context, volunteered geographic information (VGI), provided by local members of non-governmental organizations or individual citizens, emerges as an important information source. This paper presents a conceptual framework to link supply chain management (SCM) processes of humanitarian organizations with VGI, in order to assist the identification of information about infrastructure and resources that are needed by humanitarian SCM processes, and to supply better sources of information fulfilling the needs. The framework&rsquo;s central component is the Humanitarian Logistics Infrastructure and Resource Model, which can be used to encapsulate information and facilitate the cross-linking of SCM and VGI systems.",Volunteered Geographic Information; Humanitarian Logistics; Logistics Infrastructure; Resource Model; Supply Chain Management,,en

A previous study treated a model where an intervention affects the non-observable underlying mean process at the time point of its occurrence and additionally the whole process thereafter via its dynamics. As an alternative, we consider a model where an intervention directly affects the observation at its occurrence, but not the underlying mean, and then also enters the dynamics of the process. While the former definition describes an internal change of the system, the latter can be understood as an external effect on the observations due to e.g. immigration. For our alternative model we develop conditional likelihood estimation and, based on this, tests and detection procedures for intervention effects. Both models are compared analytically and using simulated and real data examples. We study the effect of model misspecification and computational issues.","['change-point detection', 'generalized linear models', 'level shifts', 'outliers', 'time series of counts']",,en

The R2 and the Hypervolume (HV) indicator represent two recommended approaches which have shown a correlated behavior in recent empirical studies. Whereas the HV indicator has been comprehensively analyzed in the last years, almost no studies on the R2 indicator exist. In this extended version of our previous conference paper, we thus perform a comprehensive investigation of the properties of the R2 indicator in a theoretical and empirical way. The influence of the number and distribution of the weight vectors on the optimal distribution of &mu; solutions is analyzed. Based on a comparative analysis, specific characteristics and differences of the R2 and HV indicator are presented. Furthermore, the R2 indicator is integrated into an indicator-based steady-state evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (EMOA).

While the real extent and economic impact is hard to quantify, scien- tists and officials agree that cybercrime is a huge and still growing problem. A substantial fraction of cybercrime&rsquo;s overall costs to society can be traced to indirect opportunity costs, resulting from unused online services.&nbsp;
<div>This paper presents a theoretically derived model that utilizes technology acceptance research and insights from Criminology to identify factors that reduce Inter- net users&rsquo; intention to use online services. We hypothesize that avoidance of online banking, online shopping and online social networking is increased by prior cybercrime victimization and media reports. The effects are mediated by perceived risk of cybercrime and moderated by the user&rsquo;s confidence on- line.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We test our hypotheses using a structural equation modeling analysis of a representative pan-European sample. Our empirical results confirm the negative impact of perceived risk of cybercrime on the usage of all three cat- egories of online services and support the role of cybercrime experience as an antecedent of perceived risk of cybercrime. We further show that more confident Internet users perceive less cybercriminal risk and are more likely to use online banking and online shopping which highlights the importance of consumer education.</div>",Information Security; Economics of Cybercrime; Avoidance of E-Services; Consumer Behavior; Perceived Risk; Technology Acceptance Model; Structural Equation Modeling,"['Integration architecture, Intelligent maintenance systems, Spare parts supply chain']",en
20532383,Turning Dark into White Clouds – A Framework on Trust Building in Cloud Providers via Websites,"Due to concerns about data security and privacy and the lack of trust, many individuals and organizations are reluctant to use cloud services. Thus, gaining users' trust in cloud computing is considered as a challenge faced by cloud providers. Previous studies in the field of trust and cloud computing mainly focus on technical aspects such as improving security. While this is important, trust is also shaped by perceptions which in turn are influenced by communication. However, this understanding of trust has been neglected in cloud computing literature so far. This paper conceptualizes the relationships between trust in cloud providers, security, risks, perceptions, and communication in a framework. Based on this understanding, previous literature in the field of trust and cloud computing is analyzed. As a result, future research should explore how cloud providers can improve the communication of implemented security and privacy measures in order to enhance trust.","['Cloud computing', 'Communication', 'Online risk perceptions', 'Security', 'Trust', 'Websites']",,en

A Quantitative Analysis amongst its Users,"Open government, which summarises all activities that deal with opening up government activities towards the citizens often with the help of social media, faces several challenges. One of these challenges is to design open government services in a way that encourages citizens to participate. In order to answer which factors influence citizens' intention to use an open government service on social media, we conducted a quantitative survey with users of the social network Facebook in Germany. Since a comprehensive German open government service does not yet exist, we developed a concept for such a service, which we used for deriving our research model. Afterwards we evaluated our model using PLS. Our results reveal that citizens have concerns over a possible open government service on Facebook.

The related work reveals a quite diverse picture both in governments' quality of social media maintenance as well as in the interaction with citizens. Our aim in this study is to understand the factors that drive governments' decisions to use social media for their external communications as well as to comprehend their underlying strategy. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study among 20 German municipalities. Our results reveal that hardly any government agency follows a distinct strategy when implementing social media. Furthermore, we come up with ten propositions that explain the influencing factors of governments' social media decision. Whereas mainly ambiguous privacy regulations and financial shortcomings negatively influence the decision to use social media, initiatives by single employees, perceived external expectations and the wish to become more attractive for citizens drive the use of social media. In addition, observed social media behaviours of other governments and experiences in the governments' environment influence the decision. Our results both give in-depth insights in governments' decision and implementation processes of social media and serve as a basis for further (quantitative) studies.","['Content analysis', 'Facebook', 'Government', 'Interviews', 'Social media', 'Strategy']","['Citizensourcing, Incentivization, Motivation, Process innovation, Public administration, Selective crowdsourcing']",en

In this paper, new features based on the cell mapping concept are introduced and shown to improve the existing feature set in terms of predicting expert-designed high-level properties, such as the degree of multimodality or the global structure, for 2-dimensional single objective optimization problems.",exploratory landscape analysis; cell mapping; black-box optimization; continuous optimization; single objective optimization; algorithm selection,"['Algorithmic skeletons, Farm skeleton, GPGPU, High-level, parallel programming']",en
20541092,Predictable Rain? Steganalysis of Public-key Steganography Using Wet Paper Codes,"Symmetric steganographic communication requires a secret stego-key pre-shared between the communicating parties. Public-key steganography (PKS) overcomes this inconvenience. In this case, the steganographic security is based solely on the underlying asymmetric encryption function. This implies that the embedding positions are either public or hidden by clever coding, for instance using Wet Paper Codes (WPC), but with public code parameters. We show that using WPC with efficient encoding algorithms may leak information which can facilitate an attack. The public parameters allow an attacker to predict among the possible embedding positions the ones most likely used for embedding. This approach is independent of the embedding operation. We demonstrate it for the case of least significant bit (LSB) replacement and present two new variants of Weighted Stego-Image (WS) steganalysis specifically tailored to detect PKS using efficient WPC. Experiments show that our WS variants can detect PKS with higher accuracy than known methods, especially for low embedding rates. The attack is applicable even if a hybrid stegosystem is constructed and public-key cryptography is only used to encapsulate a secret stego-key.",public-key steganography; weighted stego-image steganalysis; wet paper codes,"['Soziale Ausgrenzung', ' Soziale Medien', ' Individuelle Informationstechnologie']",en
20542058,On the Combination of Randomized Thresholds and Non-Parametric Boundaries to Protect Digital Watermarks against Sensitivity Attacks,"With unlimited access to a watermark detector, an attacker can use sensitivity attacks to remove the watermark of a digital medium. Randomized detectors and non-parametric decision boundaries are two ways of defending the watermark against these attacks. However, both approaches have their vulnerabilities when used individually. The first enables working with the randomized region boundary. The second still provides reliable information. This paper presents a combination of these two approaches to overcome their shortcomings. We develop a detector that has a randomized region with non-parametric outer boundaries. To empirically evaluate our combination, we apply two attack algorithms: Kalker's attack and Blind Newton Sensitivity Attack. The combination is more effective than the non-parametric boundary alone and comparable with using only the randomized threshold. In addition, we increase security by preventing attacks against the outer boundaries.",Sensitivity Attacks; Digital Watermarks,"['Business Process Management', ' Organizational Routine', ' Structuration Theory', ' Emergence', ' Design', ' Social Construction of Technology']",en
20545858,Process Mining Approaches to Detect Organizational Properties in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are service systems that connect physical and cyber elements through global networks. CPS put upon sensors and actuators as well as omnipresent status data of smart products in order to facilitate the design of innovative service offerings. CPS typically require the co-operation of several actors such as manufacturers of smart products and service providers. Organizational mining uses event log data produced by information systems to explore organizational structures and to analyze social networks representing communication structures. Hence, organizational mining is a promising approach for changing the organization of several actors in a CPS for the better and for improving the delivery of innovative CPS service offerings. However, approaches of this kind so far have not been discussed with regard to CPS. From a review of the literature on organizational mining this article therefore identifies 18 different approaches, and it discusses their requirements and possible challenges and obstacles of using them in a CPS. The main results from the analysis include that organizational mining may generally be well applicable to CPS while some serious challenges related to CPS characteristics such as distribution in space, different levels of granularity, and time issus require for further research.",Organizational Mining; Cyber-Physical Systems; Process Mining; Role Mining,,en

The main results obtained are: Scholars from both fields - while working on similar research problems - tend to employ different research methods and research tools. There also exist separated publication strands. From the set of papers that either belong to or cite papers from one of the fields, we found only three papers that cite organizational routines and process mining publications at the same time and another six papers on organizational routines that refer to process mining.

20552424,Conceptual Approach for Integrating Tactical Spare Parts Inventory Management and Transport Planning,"The most striking challenges of spare parts supply chain management can be seen in the availability of the needed spare part(s), the ability to deploy the appropriately qualified service personnel, and the provision of required equipment, at the right place and the requested time. To meet these requirements, a well-organized planning of all tasks in spare parts supply chain management is required. The tasks to be considered here are production, inventory, and transport planning, as well as the planning of the service personnel and equipment. Focusing on the two most important planning tasks, being inventory and transportation planning, it is needed to determine the stock levels of all warehouses along a spare parts supply chain and the transports. To satisfy the spare parts demand quickly, sufficient spare parts need to be available while on the other hand the inventory costs shall be reduced. For dealing with this trade-off the inventories as well as the transports have to be aligned along a spare parts supply chain in a simultaneously manner. To address this, this article is providing a conceptual approach how spare parts inventory and transport planning can be integrated. The integration is based on existing methods which are analyzed concerning their applicability to spare parts supply chain management and in how far these methods needs to be extended. Based on this investigation, the result is a conceptual approach of a tactical integrated planning model which is able to align the inventories and transports along a spare parts supply chain by reducing the total costs.","['integrated planning', 'inventory management', 'spare parts supply chain management', 'transport planning']","['Collaboration, Organizational issues, Technostress']",en
20552502,Integration Architecture of Intelligent Maintenance Systems and Spare Parts Supply Chain Planning,"Global competition has led to more complex production systems, in which efficient maintenance is critical for operational competitiveness. The effects of poor maintenance levels can have huge economic impacts in such production systems. To avoid this problem, it is necessary, on one hand, to be able to estimate maintenance needs in advance, thus be able to avoid unforeseen breakdowns and production interruption. On the other hand, management and planning of spare parts supply chain systems become more important due to the difficulty of ensuring spare parts availability while keeping reasonable inventory and transportation costs. To address both points, research in the domains of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) and Advanced Planning Systems (APS) for spare parts supply chains have been arising in recent years, providing means to forecast device failures by the analysis of sensorial inputs, resulting in the ability to forecast maintenance and spare parts needs more precisely. The integration of IMS and APS makes it also possible to adapt the machine parameters according to the reactivity of the spare parts supply chain and to enable its usage until the spare parts are available. One important challenge in this context is the proper integration of both types of systems, coping with the different backgrounds and levels of abstraction found, like shop-floor IMS devices and the systems employed by APS providers. This paper will address this integration problem by proposing an architecture to integrate IMS devices and APS planning components, starting from modelling domains and actors, analysing the effects variables and components from IMS and APS have on each other and conceptualizing an architecture for the integration. Expected results are high-level concepts for the system architecture, an ontology for modelling the spare parts and maintenance systems domain, proposition of an integration layer and features for message exchange and adaptive machine behaviour.","['Integration architecture', 'Intelligent maintenance systems', 'Spare parts supply chain']","['Consumer Search Behaviour', ' Online Panel Data', ' Market Structure', ' International and Multi-Sector Research']",en
20571015,A Business Process Model for the Reverse Logistics of Used Electric Vehicle Batteries,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as a ground-breaking innovation for making transportation services more sustainable. Electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) are the major technological components of electric vehicles and account for up to one third of the EVs' initial price. Due to continued cell degradation, EVBs need to be removed from the EVs after some time, but might still be reused in different scenarios such as stationary applications. EVBs that cannot be reused must be recycled to retain valuable materials such as cobalt, lithium, and nickel. The purpose of this paper is to develop a business process model for the reverse logistics of EVBs, transporting them from car workshops to their next usage sites or to adequate recycling facilities. We develop the business process model in a design research endeavor, based on reviewing selected laws and regulations that need to be complied with when transporting high-voltage batteries.",,"['Online Search', ' Online Consumer Behaviour', ' Cross-sector Study', ' Online Consideration Set']",en

One possible solution to the dilemma of shrinking resources and increasing demands is open innovation. Various papers have already established the idea of crowdsourcing as a means of open innovation in the public sector. In order to enrich theory and practice in the field of collaborative innovation processes, this research focuses on the willingness of citizens to participate in crowdsourcing for innovation. More specifically, we highlight the role of expert citizens in selective crowdsourcing for complex tasks in the public sector with the concrete example of process innovations. We examine different levels of willingness to participate in crowdsourcing by means of a quantitative analysis of a questionnaire survey with n=128 German citizens. Our analysis shows that citizens are indeed motivated to participate in selective crowdsourcing to generate solutions to complex problems in the public sector. Although mobilizing adequate experts for complex tasks may seem challenging, we find that expert citizens actually have a higher willingness to collaborate on complex as well as simple tasks than non-experts. Additionally, financial incentives remain a relevant instrument in the design of citizensourcing projects. Ultimately, the role of age as an influence to participate in crowdsourcing will be discussed.","['Citizensourcing', 'Incentivization', 'Motivation', 'Process innovation', 'Public administration', 'Selective crowdsourcing']",,en

20600383,A Scalable Farm Skeleton for Heterogeneous Parallel Programming,"Nowadays, multi-core processors and GPUs with thousands of cores are omnipresent. Fully exploiting their resources involves dealing with low-level concepts of parallel programming. These low-level concepts still constitute a high barrier to efficient development of parallel applications. That is why we need high-level tools for parallel programming. In order to assist programmers in developing performant and reliable parallel applications Algorithmic Skeletons have been proposed. They encapsulate well-defined, frequently recurring parallel programming patterns, thereby shielding programmers from low-level aspects of parallel programming. In this paper we take on the design and implementation of the well-known Farm skeleton. In order to address heterogeneous computing platforms we present a multi-tier implementation on top of MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. On the basis of two benchmark applications, including an interacting particles system and a ray tracing application, we illustrate the advantages of both skeletal programming in general and this multi-tier approach in particular.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'Farm skeleton', 'GPGPU', 'High-level', 'parallel programming']",,en

20630600,Exploring the Interplay of the Design and Emergence of Business Processes as Organizational Routines,"Much of the BPM literature views business process design and implementation as a top-down process that is built on strategic alignment and managerial control. While this view has enabled the design of many IT artifacts for business processes, it is inconsistent with the observation that information infrastructures, including a company's business process infrastructure, are at drift, a term that refers to the lack of top-down management control. The paper contributes to resolving this inconsistency by developing a meta-framework that conceptualizes business processes as emergent organizational routines that are represented, enabled, and constrained by IT artifacts. IT artifacts are developed in processes of functional-hierarchical decomposition and social design processes. Organizational routines have ostensive and performative aspects, forming a mutually constitutive duality. A literature review demonstrates that the propositions offered by the meta-framework have been insufficiently considered in the BPM field. The paper concludes with an outlook to applying the meta-framework to theorizing on the interplay of design projects with the subsequent emergence of business processes in organizations.",Business Process Management; Organizational Routine; Structuration Theory; Emergence; Design; Social Construction of Technology,,en

As a result, an increased heterogeneity of hard- and software makes it challenging to deliver central IT support. Therefore, employees might increasingly rely on the help of their colleagues. In such a user-to-user support scenario, traditional communication media such as text chat and telephone are used. In this context, we set out to investigate the effects of social presence, i.e. the feeling of human warmth, in a laboratory experiment. While this feeling of human contact is assumed to be important in an increas-ingly digitized world, our findings could not confirm this hypothesis. In contrast to the media richness theory, our study shows that audio compared to text chat has no impact on social presence and no subsequent effect on trust. However, we could confirm the relationship of social presence on enjoy-ment and show that trust leads facilitates information gathering. Our findings may be limited due to the use of an answer script of the human support playing a colleague as counterpart for the partici-pants. We relate our shortcomings to theory and provide potential avenues for future experimental studies on user-to-user support.",user-to-user support; individual information systems; social presence; enjoyment; trust,,en

20651362,A Reflexive and Interactive Approach on Novice-based Data Collection to Investigate Information Infrastructure (II),"From the practice lens the use of artefacts is subject to implicit logic, tacit know-how, and embodied practical sense and is constantly negotiated in the context of performance and within a constellation of practices. We argue that this theoretical approach provides useful assumptions to study Information Infrastructure (II) beyond the conventional understanding of II as &ldquo;tubes and wires&rdquo;. Bringing practices into perspective we aim at better understanding the unexpected outcome of II development projects in healthcare. Methodically, this research requires a strategy to trap the opacity of practice. Being an expert transcends technical rationality and is built up from practice which tends to be tacit. Infrastructure is embedded into opaque work practices and transparent to use. Taking this methodical problem into account we suggest studying practices by novice practitioners as they are not yet &ldquo;practice blind&rdquo;. By diary writing they contribute to data collection. This idea allows analysing practices &lsquo;from inside&rsquo;, however puts the researcher in a novel position and bears methodical challenges. By suggesting a reflexive and interactive methodological approach we aim at contributing to practice-based research methods.

Thus, stressor-related questions cannot differentiate between how strain might be experienced in different roles assumed in the workplace. This paper aims to investigate, by means of an experiment, how different roles in a work arrangement affect the perception of strain.

20662208,An Analysis of Consumer Search Behaviour in the US and Germany using Online Panel Data,"Consumer search is analysed in a cross-sector study of six markets in the US and Germany using online panel data.

The online consideration sets range from 2.3 to 3.1 in the US and from 2.3 to 2.6 in Germany, regardless of the use of price comparison engines. These results are significantly smaller than expected compared to pre-Internet studies and theory predictions. However, they are consistent with the few published results that used online panel data. It is shown that the online consideration set is a function of market structure. Time spent per brand is not related to market structure and is likely to be determined by product-market factors such as product complexity, product involvement and risk. The use of price comparison engines is inversely related to product complexity.

The language supports topologically exact as well as similar pattern matching and includes additional constraints and attributes in the matching process. In doing so, the language is applicable to many different analysis tasks.

20785780,Hierarchy or Activity? The Role of Formal and Informal Influence in Eliciting Responses From Enterprise Social Networks,"Social Media is associated with improved communication, information-sharing and has been argued to lead to more democratic communication patterns, whereby users increasingly derive authority from their contributions to the network rather than their position in the formal hierarchy. At the same time, this development remains largely un-explored. Against this background, we explore the influence of both a user&rsquo;s hierarchical level and level of communication activity on their ability to elicit responses from other ESN users. We draw on a unique data set of more than 130,000 messages collected from the ESN platform Yammer at Deloitte Australia. We confirm the existence of both kinds of influence, formal and informal, yet we show that communication activity has a much stronger effect than a user&rsquo;s hierarchical position. We conclude that communication behaviour has a bigger influence on information diffusion than formal hierarchies. This points to the potentials of enterprise social networks in improving organic, user-driven communication and knowledge-sharing within firms.","['Communication analysis', 'Enterprise social networking', 'Hierarchy', 'Influence', 'Microblogging', 'Response behaviour', 'Yammer']","['Condition Monitoring, Forecasts, Spare Parts Management']",en

20791104,Supporting Terminological Standardization in Conceptual Models – A Plugin for a Meta-Modelling Tool,"Today&rsquo;s enterprises are accumulating huge repositories of conceptual models, such as data models, organisational charts and most notably business process models. Those models often grew heterogeneously with the company and thus often are terminologically divers and complex. This terminological diversity originates from the fact that the natural language allows an issue to be described in a large variety of ways especially when many modellers are involved. This diversity can become a pitfall when conceptual models are subject to model analysis techniques, which require terminological comparable modelling elements. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the model quality by enforcing naming conventions. This paper introduces a prototype, which intends to resolve all associated issues of terminological standardisation during modelling already. Therefore, the modeller is guided through the standardization process by providing an automated list of all correct phrase propositions according to his entered phrase.

20792175,Drivers for the Adoption of Mobile Device Management in Organizations,"The diffusion of mobile devices rapidly increased in the last decade. Nowadays, smartphones are part of our daily lives, both with respect to private and professional use. This leads to several challenges for enterprises, like the trend to ""Bring Your Own Device"" or IT consumerization. IT executives are forced to ensure a high level of security, provide services for employees and support the enterprise productivity. In this context, several software solutions have been introduced to manage the mobile IT, one of which are mobile device management (MDM) systems. However, until now, there is a lack of research concerning possible factors that may influence the adoption of MDM systems in enterprises. Based on the well-established Technology Organization Environment (TOE) Framework a model for MDM adoption in enterprises is constructed and tested using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Data was gathered by means of an online survey, in which 95 IT executives from German enterprises participated. Overall, it could be found that perceived security benefits, costs, firm-size, and the BYOD culture significantly influence MDM adoption, while regulations, business partners, employees' innovativeness with IT and the amount of mobile device usage have no significant influence.",IT-adoption; TOE; Mobile Device Management; IT-Management,,en

20811354,Mobile Applications for Knowledge Workers and Field Workers,"In recent years, the diffusion of mobile applications (mobile apps) has risen significantly. Nowadays, standardized mobile business apps are strongly emerging in business. However, the usage of customized mobile enterprise apps is still an exception. Standardized mobile apps enable mobile data storage and exchange (e.g. dropbox), communication (e.g. skype), and other standardized processes, which mainly support knowledge workers. But mobile apps can do more. Mobile apps can for example increase the flexibility of mobile workers in general, ease the access to firm&rsquo;s information from outside the enterprise, and enable ubiquitous collaboration. Hence, mobile apps can generate competitive advantages and can increase work efficiency on a broad scale. This research shows - on the basis of two case studies that mobile workers form no coherent group. Mobile workers can be clustered in different types such as knowledge workers and field workers. They fulfill different tasks, work in different environments and have different requirements for mobile support. The question arises, which mobile apps should be used by whom for which task and in which environment. These questions affect multiple corporate levels. We conclude in this paper that the corporate transition from classical business to mobile business must be accompanied by a thorough specification, implementation and usage of task- and firm-specific (individualized) enterprise apps instead of employing standardized mobile business apps.",Knowledge Workers; Field Workers; Apps; Mobile,"['Big Data', ' Business Intelligence', ' Business Analytics']",en

Application scenarios include comparing or integrating business processes, checking business processes for compliance or weaknesses, and customizing conceptual models for different audiences. Many companies maintain large model collections. Analysing such collections manually can be laborious. Hence, practitioners have articulated demand for (semi-)automatic support. BPM scholars address this demand with a plethora of different model analysis techniques. As most conceptual models can be interpreted as mathematical graphs and model analysis techniques often include some kind of graph problem, we introduce a model analysis framework based on graph algorithms. These algorithms are supposed to be used as building blocks in higher-level model analysis techniques. To prove that graph algorithms are applicable in this domain, we conduct a performance analysis of selected algorithms.","['Business process modeling', 'Graph algorithms', 'Model analysis', 'Model collection management']","['Knowledge, Knowledge creation, Social constructivism, Social representations, WikiGen, Wikipedia']",en

20869481,Iceberg ahead: On electronic government research and societal aging,"More than ten years ago, Peterson (1999, p. 3) warned that ""[g]lobal aging, like a massive iceberg, looms ahead."" Government budgets have already been hit hard by a simultaneous increase in governmental spending and a decline in tax revenue related to a growing share of the elderly to the total population. While almost all industrialized countries can expect an aging population and resulting budget stress, the implications of the graying of society for a ""graying of e-Government initiatives and budgets"" are not readily apparent and therefore constitutes a subject worthy of investigation. Despite the increasing importance of this issue for e-Government in practice, there remains a clear need to assess our understanding and reflection of the phenomenon. Therefore, we examine (a) whether e-Government research presently provides adequate theory, vocabulary, and methods and (b) the extent to which future e-Government research is potentially able to contribute to tackling the substantial theoretical and practical challenges related to societal aging. Accordingly, we pursue a multi-method approach in terms of sequentially applying a retrospective literature review (12 journals, vol. 2000-2009) and a prospective Delphi study (involving 24 e-Government experts). The results suggest that there is currently a significant gap between actual and potential e-Government research on societal aging. We discuss the implications for future e-Government research and describe potentially fruitful ways of bridging the prevailing gap between theory and practice. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","['Delphi study', 'Electronic government', 'Gerontology', 'Literature review', 'Multi-method research', 'Research agenda', 'Senior citizens', 'Societal aging']",,en

Millions of people play online games regularly. At the same time, game vendors' revenues are increasing. As a new emergence, virtual (i.e. in-game) goods are traded for real money. However, not much research has been conducted on the monetary effects of virtual economies. Therefore, the authors present the theoretical background and a study aiming to understand how game vendors' actions reflect on the monetary value of virtual goods. The study is based on a huge dataset gained from Web shops that were monitored over a period of several months. The data was analysed in order to find out whether effects known from real economies apply to their virtual counterparts.

They provide scalable performance yet introducing complex and low-level programming models for shared and distributed memory programming. Thus, fully exploiting the potential of shared and distributed memory parallelization can be a tedious and error-prone task: programmers must take care of low-level threading and communication (e.g. message passing) details. In order to assist programmers in developing performant and reliable parallel applications Algorithmic Skeletons have been proposed. They encapsulate well-defined, frequently recurring parallel and distributed programming patterns, thus shielding programmers from low-level aspects of parallel and distributed programming. In this paper we take on the design and implementation of the well-known Farm skeleton. In order to address the hybrid architecture of multi-core clusters we present a two-tier implementation built on top of MPI and OpenMP. On the basis of three benchmark applications, including a simple ray tracer, an interacting particles system, and an application for calculating the Mandelbrot set, we illustrate the advantages of both skeletal programming in general and this two-tier approach in particular.",High-level parallel programming; Algorithmic skeletons; Farm skeleton; Shared/distributed memory,,en

Since typically the solution set of such multi-objective optimization problems forms a manifold which cannot be computed analytically, one is in many cases interested in a suitable finite size approximation of this set. One widely used approach is to find a representative set that maximizes the dominated hypervolume that is defined by the images in objective space of these solutions and a given reference point. In this paper, we propose a new point-wise iterative search procedure, Hypervolume Directed Search (HVDS), that aims to increase the hypervolume of a given point in an archive for bi-objective unconstrained optimization problems. We present the HVDS both as a standalone algorithm and as a local searcher within a specialized evolutionary algorithm.

21009230,Indicator-based Selection in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms Based On the Desirability Index,"In multiobjective optimization, the identification of practically relevant solutions on the Pareto-optimal front is an important research topic. Desirability functions (DFs) allow the preferences of the decision maker to be specified in an intuitive way. Recently, it has been shown for continuous optimization problems that an a priori transformation of the objectives by means of DFs can be used to focus the search of a hypervolume-based evolutionary algorithm on the desired part of the front. In many-objective optimization, however, the computational complexity of the hypervolume can become a crucial part. Thus, an alternative to this approach will be presented in this paper. The new algorithm operates in the untransformed objective space, but the desirability index (DI), that is, a DF-based scalarization, will be used as the second-level selection criterion in the non-dominated sorting. The diversity and uniform distribution of the resulting approximation are ensured by the use of an external archive. In the experiments, different preferences are specified as DFs, and their effects are investigated. It is shown that trade-off solutions are generated in the desired regions of the Pareto-optimal front and with a density adaptive to the DI. The efficiency of the approach with respect to increasing objective space dimension is also analysed using scalable test functions. The convergence speed is superior to other set-based and preference-based evolutionary multiobjective algorithms while the approach is of low computational complexity due to cheap DI evaluations.",decision making; desirability function; desirability index; evolutionary multiobjective optimization; hypervolume; preferences; MOEA; archive,"['Information and communication technologies', ' mobile technologies', ' business process', ' small and medium business']",en

21025504,Managing the weakest link: A game-theoretic approach for the mitigation of insider threats,"We introduce a two-player stochastic game for modeling secure team selection to add resilience against insider threats. A project manager, Alice, has a secret she wants to protect but must share with a team of individuals selected from within her organization; while an adversary, Eve, wants to learn this secret by bribing one potential team member. Eve does not know which individuals will be chosen by Alice, but both players have information about the bribeability of each potential team member. Specifically, the amount required to successfully bribe each such individual is given by a random variable with a known distribution but an unknown realization. We characterize best-response strategies for both players, and give necessary conditions for determining the game's equilibria. We find that Alice's best strategy involves minimizing the information available to Eve about the team composition. In particular, she should select each potential team member with a non-zero probability, unless she has a perfectly secure strategy. In the special case where the bribeability of each employee is given by a uniformly-distributed random variable, the equilibria can be divided into two outcomes - either Alice is perfectly secure, or her protection is based only on the randomness of her selection. &copy; 2013 Springer-Verlag.",Access Control; Computer Security; Cyberespionage; Game Theory; Insider Threats,"['Social BPM', ' Challenges', ' Human-Centric BPM']",en

Theory, Practice, and Challenges for Future Research","The paper depicts the current state of IS strategy research with the aim of identifying research needs as well as appropriate ways to study IS strategy in the future. To this end, the paper introduces the results of an extensive analysis of academic literature on IS-strategy. In addition, it sheds light on current practice as uncovered in case-study research and through in-depth interviews with IS strategy professionals. A comparison reveals that the issues prevalent in practice and the ones traditionally focused on in the academic debate on IS strategy often vary considerably. A conspicuous attempt to fill this is the so-called ""Strategizing"" framework put forward by Robert Galliers. This framework, which is receiving increasing attention in the current academic debate, calls for a practice turn in IS strategy research in that it treats strategy as something people or, more precisely, IS strategists do. In addition, by identifying the challenges and problems IS strategists are faced with, the framework intends to better reflect the new planning conditions which are often seen as characteristics of the information age. The framework distinguishes three general problem domains of IS strategizing: exploration, exploitation, as well as implementation and change management.",Strategic information systems planning; Information systems strategy; Strategic information systems; Strategy conceptions; Strategy contents; Strategy rationales,"['Incentives', ' higher education', ' blended learning', ' satisfaction', ' learning management system']",en

Moreover, SMA can provide architectural designs and solution frameworks for new social media-based applications and information systems. Finally, we call for an interdisciplinary SMA research agenda as well as a significantly increased level of interdisciplinary research co-operation, which must aim to generate significant advancements in scientific methods for analyzing social media, as well as to answer research questions from across different disciplines.",social media analytics; information systems; Big Data; interdisciplinary methods; research agenda; interdisciplinary co-operation,"['Service productivity', ' DEA', ' Data Envelopment Analysis', ' Service Science']",en
21045490,Does Human Warmth Matter? – An Experiment on User Profiles in Initial Business Interaction,"Social Presence (SP), i.e. the feeling of human warmth, is usually treated as a desirable outcome of interpersonal communication. This is in line with the current trend of Online Social Networks (OSN) where social interaction on basis of user profiles is being promoted. The rise of OSNs also includes enterprise software. While previous studies in this field deal with the question of adoption, the role of the user profile has been neglected. This study addresses this research gap by focusing on user profiles and evaluating the effect on SP, Trust and Enjoyment in an initial business interaction. The findings suggest that for an information exchange task, user profiles do not help to create SP. Thus, the potential of OSNs in enhancing communication may be constrained. Due to some limitations of this laboratory experiment and as part of future research, it is suggested to re-evaluate the findings in more natural settings.",User Profile; Social Presence; Trust; Enjoyment,,en

","Enterprise social networks are organizationally bounded online platforms for users to interact with another and maintain interpersonal relationships. The allure of these technologies is often seen in intra-organizational communication, collaboration and innovation. How these technologies actually support organizational innovation efforts remains unclear. A specific challenge is whether digital content on these platforms converts to actual innovation development efforts. In this study we set out to examine innovation-centric content flows on enterprise social networking platforms, and advance a conceptual model that seeks to explain which innovation conveyed in the digital content will traverse from the digital platform into regular processes. We describe important constructs of our model and offer strategies for the operationalization of the constructs. We conclude with an outlook to our ongoing empirical study that will explore and validate the key propositions of our model, and we sketch some potential implications for industry and academia.",Enterprise 2.0; Enterprise software/systems; Innovation,,en
21050467,On the Design of IT Artifacts and the Emergence of Business Processes as Organizational Routines,"Much of the BPM literature views business process design and implementation as a top-down process that is built on strategic alignment and managerial control. This view is inconsistent with the observation that information infrastructures, including a company's business process infrastructure, are at drift, a term that refers to the lack of top-down management control. The paper contributes to resolving this inconsistency by developing a framework that conceptualizes business processes as emergent organizational routines that are represented, enabled, and constrained by IT artifacts. IT artifacts are developed in processes of functional-hierarchical decomposition and social design processes. Organizational routines have ostensive and performative aspects, forming a mutually constitutive duality. A literature review demonstrates that the propositions offered by the framework have been insufficiently considered in the BPM field. The paper concludes with an outlook to applying the framework to theorizing on the emergence of business processes on online social network sites.",Business Process Management; Organizational Routine; Structuration Theory; Emergence; Design; Social Construction of Technology,,en

21050620,Comparison of Optimization Techniques for Complex Supply Chain Network Planning Problems,"Planning tasks in Supply Chain Management demonstrate a high complexity due to several influences such as globalization effects, mass customization of products and shorter product life cycles. This is leading to additional requirements for logistics planning in general. Nevertheless, the planning and management of supply chains is a key capability for today&rsquo;s companies in order to increase profitability as well as decrease the uncertainty and the risk of certain actions taken by one or more members of the supply chain. In this context, Supply Chain Network Planning (SCNP) is used to determine an adequate allocation of demands and capacities in storage, transportation and production facilities, aiming to fulfill customer demands at minimal costs. As a planning model on the tactical level, SCNP can be used as an important input for operational planning tasks, e.g. for a more detailed transport planning. However, due to the complexity of the problem, exact mathematical solution techniques can consume a high amount of time, and are as such not applicable in practice. Logistics decision support systems, like Advanced Planning Systems (APS) extend them therefore with heuristics or offer meta-heuristic solution approaches, each in order to provide good solutions in short timeframes. Despite this, there is a constant need for new, more efficient techniques to tackle the increasing complexity of modern supply chains and to handle ever shorter planning cycles. Therefore, this paper seeks to explore the possibilities of applying modern meta-heuristic optimization techniques onto SCNP problems.",Supply Chain Planning; Optimization; Metaheuristics,,en

However, research lacks an analysis of possible antecedents of the trend on an individual level. To close this gap, we derive a theoretical model for IT consumerization behavior based on the theory of planned behavior and perform a quantitative analysis. Our investigation shows that it is foremost determined by normative pressures, specifically the behavior of friends, co-workers and direct supervisors. In addition, behavioral beliefs and control beliefs were found to affect the intention to use non-corporate IT. With respect to the former, we found expected performance improvements and an increase in ease of use to be two of the key determinants. As for the latter, especially monetary costs and installation knowledge were correlated with IT consumerization intention.",IT Consumerization; Individual Information Systems; Theory of Planned Behavior,,en
21054959,The Influence of Learning Management System Components on Learners’ Motivation in a Large-Scale Social Learning Environment,"Blended learning is becoming increasingly important in information systems research and education. One major drawback is to foster student&rsquo;s motivation to actively participate in blended learning environments. There is still little understanding about the perceived value of incentives and components of learning management systems. Therefore, we investigated the perceived value of incentives. Furthermore, we analyze incentives&rsquo; and LMS components&rsquo; influence on learner motivation during a large-scale lecture. Based on the theoretical background of the ARCS model, we found that the perceived value of self-tests and forums have a substantial influence on learners&rsquo; motivation. In particular, the findings suggest that a clear communication of the components&rsquo; benefits is likely to positively influence learners&rsquo; attention, confidence, and perceived relevance. We also show that lecturers can influence perceptions of components by means of incentives. These results are valuable to develop LMS environments.",Incentives; higher education; blended learning; satisfaction; learning management system,,en

The goal of our study is to investigate the influence of Interventions on schoolgirls’ intentions to choose a career in the ICT field by analysing the comprehensive survey data (n = 3577), collected during four interventions in Australia, using the Partial Least Squares method. Our study is also aimed at identifying other factors influencing ICT career intentions. We found that the attitude towards interventions has an indirect influence on ICT career intentions by affecting interest in ICT.

21061045,Towards Model-Driven Engineering for Big Data Analytics – An Exploratory Analysis of Domain-Specific Languages for Machine Learning,"Graphical models and general purpose inference algorithms are powerful tools for moving from imperative towards declarative specification of machine learning problems. Although graphical models define the principle information necessary to adapt inference algorithms to specific probabilistic models, entirely model-driven development is not yet possible. However, generating executable code from graphical models could have several advantages. It could reduce the skills necessary to implement probabilistic models and may speed up development processes. Both advantages address pressing industry needs. They come along with increased supply of data scientist labor, the demand of which cannot be fulfilled at the moment. To explore the opportunities of model-driven big data analytics, I review the main modeling languages used in machine learning as well as inference algorithms and corresponding software implementations. Gaps hampering direct code generation from graphical models are identified and closed by proposing an initial conceptualization of a domain-specific modeling language.",,,en
21061198,An Inquiry into Money Laundering Tools in the Bitcoin Ecosystem,"We provide a first systematic account of opportunities and limitations of anti-money laundering (AML) in Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptographic currency proliferating on the Internet. Our starting point is the observation that Bitcoin attracts criminal activity as many say it is an anonymous transaction system. While this claim does not stand up to scrutiny, several services offering increased transaction anonymization have emerged in the Bitcoin ecosystem -- such as Bitcoin Fog, BitLaundry, and the Send Shared functionality of Blockchain.info. In a series of experiments, we use reverse-engineering methods to understand the mode of operation and try to trace anonymized transactions back to our probe accounts. While Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info successfully anonymize our test transactions, we can link the input and output transactions of BitLaundry. Against the backdrop of these findings, it appears unlikely that a Know-Your-Customer principle can be enforced in the Bitcoin system. Hence, we sketch alternative AML strategies accounting for imperfect knowledge of true identities but exploiting public information in the transaction graph, and discuss the implications for Bitcoin as a decentralized currency.","['Bitcoin', 'Deanonymization', 'Money Laundering']",,en

The aim of this article is to provide a novel benchmarking method to measure productivity. Based on authoritative theories on service productivity, the ontological concepts of four theories of service productivity management are unified. Subse- quently, formulations of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) are stated to implement these concepts of ser- vice productivity. However, there hasn&rsquo;t been a single DEA-based approach detected that unifies the service productivity concepts for the purpose of service benchmarking. Therefore, such a model is developed by taking DEA as a starting point. It is then applied to benchmark shifts of 63 service technicians from a field force unit of one of Germany&rsquo;s biggest mobile service providers. In an evaluation based on data from these shifts the model delivers sound results. Hence, it is deemed suitable for benchmarking productivity in the service sector.",Service productivity; DEA; Data Envelopment Analysis; Service Science,,en

","E-learning has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. It is often perceived as a group effort, where content authors, instructional designers, multimedia technicians, teachers, trainers, database administrators, and people from various other areas of expertise come together in order to serve a community of learners. In a typical e-learning scenario, many of the activities can be perceived and modeled as processes and consequently be executed as workflows; there are even prototypical system developments that are experimenting with this approach. On the other hand, there are increasingly many activities, which aim at providing services of any kind on the Web; these can occur as business-to-business or as business-to-consumer services and are generally subsumed under the term Web services. In this paper we suggest to combine the areas of e-learning and Web services, by providing electronic learning offerings as (individual or collections of) Web services as well. We elaborate on this by showing how content providers and content consumers (i.e., learners) can communicate appropriately through a Web service platform with its common description, publication, and retrieval functionalities. Finally, we indicate how a corresponding system can be realized. © 2003 IEEE.",,,en

Indeed, conceptual models for service specification are rare so far, as are investigations based on them.

This paper considers mashups, which are a way of allowing an application to grow beyond the capabilities of the original developers. First, it introduces several approaches to integrate mashups into the services, or Web pages, that they are based upon. These approaches commonly implement ways to determine which mashups are potentially relevant for display in a certain Web page context. One approach, ActiveTags, enables users to create reliable mashups based on tags, which effectively, leads to customized views of Web pages with tagged content. A scenario that demonstrates the potential benefits of this approach is presented. Second, a formalization of the approaches is presented which uses a relational analog to show their commonalities. The abstraction from implementation specifics opens the range of vision for fundamental capabilities and gives a clear picture of future work.","['Application customization', 'Mashups', 'Meta-programming', 'Social tagging', 'Web customization']",,en

For instance, elderly people (65 years of age and older) are significantly less likely to use the Internet than the average population (see, for instance, European Commission, 2011). This age-related digital divide prevents many elderly people from using IT to enhance their quality of life through tools, such as Internet-based service delivery. Despite the significance of this phenomenon, the information systems (IS) literature lacks a comprehensive consideration and explanation of technology acceptance in general and more specifically, Internet adoption by the elderly. This paper thus studies the intentions of the elderly with regard to Internet use and identifies important influencing factors. Four alternative models based on technology acceptance theory are tested in the context of comprehensive survey data. As a result, a model that explains as much as 84% of the variance in technology adoption among the elderly is developed. We discuss the contribution of our analyses to the research on Internet adoption (and IT adoption in general) by the elderly, on the digital divide, and on technology acceptance and identify potentially effective paths for future research and theoretical development.

21131183,Elasticity in Cloud Databases and Their Query Processing,"A central promise of cloud services is elastic, on-demand provisioning. The provisioning of data on temporarily available nodes is what makes elastic database services a hard problem. The essential task that enables elastic data services is bringing a node and its data up-to-date. Strategies for high availability do not satisfy the need in this context because they bring nodes online and up-to-date by repeating history, e.g., by log shipping. Nodes must become up-to-date and useful for query processing incrementally by key range. What is wanted is a technique such that in a newly added node, during each short period of time, an additional small key range becomes up-to-date, until eventually the entire dataset becomes up-to-date and useful for query processing, with overall update performance comparable to a traditional high-availability strategy that carries the entire dataset forward without regard to key ranges. Even without the entire dataset being available, the node is productive and participates in query processing tasks. The authors&rsquo; proposed solution relies on techniques from partitioned B-trees, adaptive merging, deferred maintenance of secondary indexes and of materialized views, and query optimization using materialized views. The paper introduces a family of maintenance strategies for temporarily available copies, the space of possible query execution plans and their cost functions, as well as appropriate query optimization techniques.",cloud databases; elasticity; distributed query processing; query execution,,en

In the area of business process mining, numerous techniques have been developed to discover the structure of business processes by means of traces they leave behind in information systems. In organizational routines literature, these traces have been identified as a valuable source of information to investigate the dynamics of routines and how they evolve over time. However, both areas have been discussed in separation only. But in both areas alike the fundamental problem is to acquire knowledge about regularities in sequences of events based on observations thereof, and thus, we argue that process mining has the potential to advance research on organizational routines. As with any data analysis problem, one has to deal with problems due to noisy data and small samples. Thus, we show in this paper how to apply simple statistical tools to pattern detection in sequences. Subsequently, we integrate this into the popular algorithm. This paves the way for statistically controlling the risk of falling for erroneous results. To the best of our knowledge, no process mining algorithm is capable of doing this. We are convinced that this will facilitate applicability in organizational routines studies.",Business Process Mining; Organizational Routines; Organizational Genetics; Sequence Analysis,"['Noise, Sequential sampling, Simulated annealing, Uncertainty']",en

21139731,Simulated Annealing in the Presence of Noise ,"In many practical optimization problems, evaluation of a solution is subject to noise, e.g., due to stochastic simulations or measuring errors. Therefore, heuristics are needed that are capable of handling such noise. This paper first reviews the state-of-the-art in applying simulated annealing to noisy optimization problems. Then, two new algorithmic variants are proposed: an improved version of stochastic annealing that allows for arbitrary annealing schedules, and a new approach called simulated annealing in noisy environments (SANE). The latter integrates ideas from statistical sequential selection in order to reduce the number of samples required for making an acceptance decision with sufficient statistical confidence. Finally, SANE is shown to significantly outperform other state-of-the-art simulated annealing techniques on a stochastic travelling salesperson problem. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","['Noise', 'Sequential sampling', 'Simulated annealing', 'Uncertainty']",,en

The transformation of raw data into reliable decisions requires effective data chain management. The data chain closes the gap between empirical collection of raw traffic data and decision-making in terms of route planning. We define the data chain for the support of route planning in city logistics. The data chain transforms raw empirical traffic data into planning data by first and second level aggregation. The single elements of the data chain are investigated in detail. We discuss basic issues of telematics-based data collection, data cleaning and data integration. The key element of the data chain is the aggregation by cluster analysis. Aggregated data is evaluated by explorative data analysis.

But if the evaluation of the objective function is computationally expensive, which is typically the case for real-worlds problems, an extensive parameter tuning phase on the original problem is prohibitive. Therefore we have developed another approach: Provided that a (computationally cheap) surrogate model is available that reflects the structural characteristics of the original problem then the parameter tuning can be run on the surrogate problem before using the best parameters thereby identified for the metaheuristic when optimizing the original problem. In this experimental study we aim to assess how many function evaluations on the original problem are necessary to build a surrogate model endowed with the characteristics of the original problem and to develop a methodology that measures to which extent such a matching has been achieved.

21147966,Towards multiobjective procedural map generation,"A search-based procedural content generation (SBPCG) algorithm for strategy game maps is proposed. Two representations for strategy game maps are devised, along with a number of objectives relating to predicted player experience. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used for searching the space of maps for candidates that satisfy pairs of these objectives. As the objectives are inherently partially conicting, the algorithm generates Pareto fronts showing how these objectives can be balanced. Such fronts are argued to be a valuable tool for designers looking to balance various design needs. Choosing appropriate points (manually or automatically) on the Pareto fronts, maps can be found that exhibit good map design according to specified criteria, and could either be used directly in e.g. an RTS game or form the basis for further human design.

21148053,TORCS sensor noise removal and multi-objective track selection for driving style adaptation,"Two related problems with TORCS car racing competition controllers are approached here. At first, we demonstrate how to handle the 10% artificial sensor noise that made proper track segment recognition quite difficult for some controllers in 2010 (when the noise was introduced). This is successfully dealt with by a combination of averaging and regression. The presented solution copes well with the natural antagonism between accuracy and the produced time lag, meaning that controllers are enabled to use full sensor information despite noise. Secondly, we suggest a solution for the problem of selecting a minimal set of controller parameter configurations suitable for several different tracks by applying principles of multi-objective optimization. While a full multi-objective approach is unfeasible here, we investigate the conflict potential between objectives (in this case tracks) in order to remove the ones that are less problematic. Naturally, the second problem is much more interesting but can only be tackled if the first one is resolved. © 2011 IEEE.",,"['Evolutionary algorithms, function optimization, landscape detection, multimodal optimization, species conservation']",en

The latter approach the question: 'What is elsewhere?' by an implicit second criterion in order to keep populations distributed over the search space. Induced by a practical problem that appears to be simple but is not easily solved, a multiobjective algorithm is proposed for solving multimodal problems. It employs an explicit diversity criterion as second objective. Experimental comparison with standard methods suggests that the multiobjective algorithm is fast and reliable and that coupling it with a local search technique is straightforward and leads to enormous quality gain.

21148497,Sequential parameter optimization applied to self-adaptation for binary-coded evolutionary algorithms,"Adjusting algorithm parameters to a given problem is of crucial importance for performance comparisons as well as for reliable (first) results on previously unknown problems, or with new algorithms. This also holds for parameters controlling adaptability features, as long as the optimization algorithm is not able to completely self-adapt itself to the posed problem and thereby get rid of all parameters. We present the recently developed sequential parameter optimization (SPO) technique that reliably finds good parameter sets for stochastically disturbed algorithm output. SPO combines classical regression techniques and modern statistical approaches for deterministic algorithms as Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE). Moreover, it is embedded in a twelve-step procedure that targets at doing optimization experiments in a statistically sound manner, focusing on answering scientific questions. We apply SPO to a question that did not receive much attention yet: Is self adaptation as known from real-coded evolution strategies useful when applied to binary-coded problems? Here, SPO enables obtaining parameters resulting in good performance of self-adaptive mutation operators. It thereby allows for reliable comparison of modified and traditional evolutionary algorithms, finally allowing for well founded conclusions concerning the usefulness of either technique. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,,en

This paper thus aims to present a novel technique that integrates the conservation of the best successive local individuals (as in the species conserving genetic algorithm) with a topological subpopulations separation (as in the multinational genetic algorithm) instead of the common but problematic radius-triggered manner. A special treatment for offspring integration, a more rigorous control on the allowed number and uniqueness of the resulting seeds, and a more efficient fitness evaluations budget management further augment a previously suggested nave combination of the two algorithms. Experiments have been performed on a series of benchmark test functions, including a problem from engineering design. Comparison is primarily conducted to show the significant performance difference to the nave combination; also the related radius-dependent conserving algorithm is subsequently addressed. Additionally, three more multimodal evolutionary methods, being either conceptually close, competitive as radius-based strategies, or recent state-of-the-art are also taken into account. We detect a clear advantage of three of the six algorithms that, in the case of our method, probably comes from the proper topological separation into subpopulations according to the existing attraction basins, independent of their locations in the function landscape. Additionally, an investigation of the parameter independence of the method as compared to the radius-compelled algorithms is systematically accomplished. © 2010 IEEE.","['Evolutionary algorithms', 'function optimization', 'landscape detection', 'multimodal optimization', 'species conservation']",,en
21149655,Measuring flow as concept for detecting game fun in the pac-man game,"Popular games often have a high-quality graphic design but quite simple-minded non player characters (NPC). Recently, Computational Intelligence (CI) methods have been discovered as suitable methods to revive NPC, making games more interesting, challenging, and funny. We present a fairly large study of human players on the simple arcade game Pac-Man, controlling the ghosts behaviors by simple strategies, neural networks or evolutionary algorithms. The player's fun is of course a subjective experience, but we presume that it is related to the psychological flow concept. We deal with the question whether flow is a more reliable measure than asking human players directly for the fun experienced during the game. In order to detect flow, we introduce a measure based on the interaction time fraction between the human-controlled Pac-Man and the ghosts, and compare the outcome to the results of a fun measure suggested by Yannakakis and Hallam [1]. © 2008 IEEE.",,,en

Our track recognition system is based on the combination of an advanced preprocessing step of the sensory data and a simple classifier that delivers six types of track shapes similar to the ones a human would recognize. Out of these, establishing a complete track model is straightforward. This model provides an information advantage to controller strategies, as it generally enables planning. We demonstrate how such a planning controller can be derived by a mixture of expert knowledge and a simple evolutionary learning approach and give experimental evidence that knowing not only the current conditions but also the big picture of the track is beneficial, as may be expected. © 2010 IEEE.",,,en

21150098,Investigation of one-go evolution strategy/quasi-newton hybridizations,"It is general knowledge that hybrid approaches can improve the performance of search heurististics. The first phase, exploration, should detect regions of good solutions, whereas the second phase, exploitation, shall tune these solutions locally. Therefore a combination (hybridization) of global and local optimization techniques is recommended. Although plausible at the first sight, it remains unclear how to implement the hybridization, e.g., to distribute the resources, i.e., number of function evaluations or CPU time, to the global and local search optimization algorithm. This budget allocation becomes important if the available resources are very limited. We present an approach to analyze hybridization in this case.

An evolutionary algorithm for numerical optimization uses this enhanced heuristic to find assignments for these control values, which in turn enable the latter to find high quality solutions for the original combinatorial problem. Additionally to the actual optimization task, we thereby experimentally analyze the heuristic's substeps. Furthermore, after finding a good assignment for a specific instance set, we can use it for similar yet different problem instances, without the need of an additional time-consuming run of the evolutionary algorithm. This concept is of particular interest in the context of computing efficient bounds within Branch-and-Cut algorithms.

The new method has accomplished the purpose for which it has been initially developed, that of a simpler alternative to the canonical SVM approach for solving the optimization component of training. ESVMs, as SVMs, are natural tools for primary application to classification. However, since the latter had been further on extended to also handle regression, it is the scope of this paper to present the corresponding evolutionary paradigm. In particular, we consider the hybridization with the classical ε-support vector regression (ε-SVR) introduced by Vapnik and the subsequent evolution of the co-efficients of the regression hyperplane, ε-evolutionary support regression (ε-ESVR) is validated on the Boston housing benchmark problem and the obtained results demonstrate the promise of ESVMs also as concerns regression. © 2006 IEEE.",,,en

Evolutionary support vector machines have been so far designed and employed in this respect only for two possible outcomes as is also customary within standard SVMs. We presently extend the proposed technique to handle multiple outcomes as well. Similarly to the two-class situation, the aim of evolutionary support vector machines remains that of evolving, in a simpler and direct manner, the coefficients of the separating surfaces induced by the mother paradigm. The canonical SVMs are herein represented in turn by the classical one-against-all, one-against-one and decision directed acyclic graph multi-class techniques.

21150988,Enhancing decision space diversity in evolutionary multiobjective algorithms,"In multi-criterion optimization, Pareto-optimal solutions that appear very similar in the objective space may have very different pre-images. In many practical applications the decision makers, who select a solution or preferred region on the Pareto-front, may want to know different pre-images of the selected solutions. Especially, this will be the case when they would like to present alternative design candidates in later stages of a multidisciplinary design process. In this paper we extend an existing CMA-ES niching framework, which has been previously applied successfully to multi-modal optimization, to the multi-criterion domain for boosting decision space diversity. At the same time, we introduce the concept of space aggregation for diversity maintenance in the aggregated spaces, i.e. search/decision and objective space. Empirical results on synthetic multi-modal bi-criteria test problems with known efficient sets and Pareto-fronts demonstrate that the diversity in the decision space can be significantly enhanced without hampering the convergence to a precise and diverse Pareto front approximation in the objective space of the original algorithm. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,"['evolutionary algorithms, experimental methodology, kriging, tuning']",en

We consider the cumulative step-size adaptation (CSA) for the variance of multivariate zero-mean normal distributions. Those are commonly used to sample new candidate solutions within metaheuristics, in particular within the CMA Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), a state-of-the-art direct-search method. Though the CMA-ES is very successful in practical optimization, its theoretical foundations are very limited because of the complex stochastic process it induces. To forward the theory on this successful method, we propose two simplifications of the CSA used within CMA-ES for step-size control. We show by experimental and statistical evaluation that they perform sufficiently similarly to the original CSA (in the considered scenario), so that a further theoretical analysis is in fact reasonable.

The underlying motivation for modifying the original algorithm was to preserve its ability to search for many optima in parallel while increasing convergence speed, especially for complex problems, through generational selection and different replacement schemes.

Especially, the selection based on the S-metric, as implemented in the SMS-EMOA, seems to be effective. A special feature of this EMOA is the greedy (μ + 1) selection. Based on a pathological example for a population of size two and a discrete Pareto front it has been proven that a (μ + 1)- (or 1-greedy) EMOA may fail in finding a population maximizing the S-metric. This work investigates the performance of (μ + 1)-EMOA with small fixed-size populations on Pareto fronts of innumerable size. We prove that an optimal distribution of points can always be achieved on linear Pareto fronts. Empirical studies support the conjecture that this also holds for convex and concave Pareto fronts, but not for continuous shapes in general. Furthermore, the pathological example is generalized to a continuous objective space and it is demonstrated that also (μ + k)-EMOA are not able to robustly detect the globally optimal distribution. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,"['Empirical analysis, Evolution strategies, Sphere function']",en

Markov chain and statistical simulation studies reveal that panmictic selection mechanisms as used in evolution strategies (ES) do not allow for maintaining several populations of similar fitness at the same time. Moreover, when using comma selection, good individuals might easily get lost if forming the minority of a population, an effect seemingly amplified by recombination.

21152162,Concerning the potential of evolutionary support vector machines,"Within the present paper, we put forward a novel hybridization between support vector machines and evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary support vector machines consider the classification task as in support vector machines but use an evolutionary algorithm to solve the optimization problem of determining the decision function. They can explicitly acquire the coefficients of the separating hyperplane, which is often not possible within the classical technique. More important, evolutionary support vector machines obtain the coefficients directly from the evolutionary algorithm and can refer them at any point during a run. In addition, they do not require properties of positive (semi-)definition for kernels within nonlinear learning. The concept can be furthermore extended to handle large amounts of data, a problem frequently occurring e.g. in spam mail detection, one of our test cases. An adapted chunking technique is therefore alternatively used. In addition to two different representations, a crowding variant of the evolutionary algorithm is tested in order to investigate whether the performance of the algorithm is maintained; its global search capabilities would be important for the prospected coevolution of non-standard kernels.

Since classification algorithms are very sensitive to feature input and the optimal feature set differs from instrument to instrument, we propose to run a multi-objective feature selection procedure before building of classification models.

21159160,The Role of Mobile Social Media in Enterprisess,"The increasing diffusion of smartphone's and usage of mobile devices in general, leads to a perennially crescendo diffusion of mobile social media. This development does not only affect private persons but also organizations such as enterprises. Companies may adopt mobile social media to communicate with customers (B2C) e.g. by utilizing location based services for advertisement management. Furthermore, companies may provide mobile social media to their own employees (B2E) to improve knowledge management and to accelerate workflow processes.  In our article we examine potentials of mobile social media and we discuss the future capabilities of technologies and mobile social media applications. Therefore, we provide an overview about how the combination of ""social media"" and ""mobile aspects"" may lead to higher business values for enterprises. Based on this, the prevailing and future usage of mobile social media in enterprises will be specified.",Mobile; Social Media; Global; Enterprise,,en
21159483,iARIS – Supporting Enterprise Transformation Using An Iterative ISD Method,"Enterprise architecture frameworks can be used to guide the development process of an information system (IS). While these frameworks cover a comprehensive approach to IS development, most of them essentially proclaim a linear, stepwise development process. In the field of computer science, such linear, waterfall-based approaches have been replaced by so-called agile methods proclaiming an iterative development process. As these approaches are naturally only concerned with software engineering, they do not consider the business processes the software is supposed to support or the organizational structures the software is supposed to be employed in. The purpose of this paper is to propose an iterative information systems development method called iARIS. It combines the ""best of both worlds"" in joining the comprehensive approach to IS development of common EA frameworks with the iterative software engineering paradigm. The paper contributes to the research on enterprise transformation in proposing a method tailored to support IS development in a rapidly changing environment. The paper furthermore reports on an on-going IS development project providing insights into how iARIS can be applied. The paper thus contributes to the research on enterprise transformation in suggesting how an IS development method can be used in practice.","['Agile Information Systems Development', 'Compliance management', 'Iaris', 'Pattern matching']","['Evolutionary multi-objective algorithm, Local search, Predator-prey model']",en

Providing guidelines on social media usage for employees is twofold: on the one hand guidelines might increase the awareness of risks, on the other hand publishing guidelines might result in a reduced employee&rsquo;s engagement in social media. In this paper we classified 34 social media guidelines of large enterprises and analyzed them by applying an open coding approach. Based on the analysis of the content we propose a framework that summarizes the most relevant aspects of content in enterprise social media guidelines.

Due to seemingly different domain specific requirements, data management solutions have been developed separately for each community grid using a selection of low-level tools and APIs. This has led to unnecessarily complex and overspecialized systems. We describe three D-Grid community grid projects, AstroGrid-D, C3Grid and MediGRID, and analyze to what degree they share the same data management requirements. As a result, we derive the viewpoint that data management systems should provide applications with data access based on declarative and logical addressing, while ensuring the required quality of service (QoS). As a possible approach for this, we describe a conceptual data management system architecture that separates application, community, and resource concerns, using three layers of addressing, thus providing a highly adaptable architecture for different community grids.

Still, the approach to peg single objectives to a predator allows a very simple algorithmic design. The building-block configuration of the predators offers potent means for fine-tuning and tackling multi-objective problems in a problem-specific way. In the work at hand, we propose the integration of local search heuristics into the classic model approach in order to overcome the unsatisfactory behavior for the aforementioned problem class.

21168430,On the Integration of Theoretical Single-Objective Scheduling Results for Multi-objective Problems,"We present a modular and flexible algorithmic framework to enable a fusion of scheduling theory and evolutionary multi-objective combinatorial optimization. For single-objective scheduling problems, that is the optimization of task assignments to sparse resources over time, a variety of optimal algorithms or heuristic rules are available. However, in the multi-objective domain it is often impossible to provide specific and theoretically well founded algorithmic solutions. In that situation, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are commonly used. Although several standard heuristics from this domain exist, most of them hardly allow the integration of available single-objective problem knowledge without complex redesign of the algorithms structure itself. The redesign and tuned application of common evolutionary multi-objective optimizers is far beyond the scope of scheduling research. We therefore describe a framework based on a cellular and agent-based approach which allows the straightforward construction of multi-objective optimizers by compositing single-objective scheduling heuristics. In a case study, we address strongly NP-hard parallel machine scheduling problems and compose optimizers combining the known single-objective results. We eventually show that this approach can bridge between scheduling theory and evolutionary multi-objective search. © Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,en

In case of a site's over-utilization, the scheduling system is able to lease resources from other sites to keep up service quality for its local user community. Contrary, the granting of idle resources can increase utilization in times of low local workload and thus ensure higher efficiency.

However, information systems (IS) research lacks a clear notion of both the concept itself and possible technological design decisions that could foster SP. Within this paper, we address this gap by providing an overview over the theory of SP for utilization in IS research. First, we develop a framework of SP dimensions and design dimensions of SP from related psychological literature. Then, we use this framework to analyze existing design choices in IS journal papers and point out shortcoming in the IS field. Our results suggest that IS needs to broaden its scope beyond iterating media richness to evoke social presence. Furthermore, current IS research mainly focuses on emotional aspects of social presence and neglects the evaluative dimension of the construct.

21228803,Boon and Bane of IT Consumerization: The Burnout-Engagement-Continuum,"IT consumerization, refers to the diffusion of consumer IT in the workplace and is considered to influence work processes in organizations. While several studies provide evidence that IT consumerization can create significant value for an organization, Volkswagen and Daimler recently applied restriction for consumer IT use to prevent stress and burnout consequences.

Thus, the foremost negatively associated relationship between IT and stress contradicts to the mostly positive perceptions of IT consumerization.

21228880,What Influences Technological Individualization? – An Analysis of Antecedents to IT Consumerization Behavior,"IT consumerization refers to the adoption of consumer IT in the workplace and is regarded as one of the major future IT trends. However, little is yet understood with respects to the antecedents of the trend on an individual level, i.e. the IT consumerization behavior of individuals. We attempt to close this research gap by means of a quantitative analysis. First, we conceptualize IT consumerization and draw clear boundaries to existing concepts in the context of individual information systems. We then set out to derive possible antecedents from literature and quantitatively test their impact on IT consumerization intention. We are able to show that expected performance improvement as well as consumerization behavior of coworkers have a high significant impact, while personal innovativeness in IT does not significantly influence the intention to user technologies other than the ones provided by the enterprise.","['Consumerization', 'Individual information systems', 'Individualization', 'Technology choice']",,en

21248638,The Regulatory Influence on Management Information Systems - A Contingency Perspective,"Reporting scandals and the financial crisis led to a massive increase of regulations. In particular financial institutions and governmental organizations are faced with a daunting number of regulatory requirements. So far, the influence of regulation on the organization and success of Management Information Systems (MIS) remains an open question. With this paper we provide a first insight into the organizational parameters that are affected by a volatile regulatory environment. Inspired by contingency theory and its application for MIS research, we first present an exploratory research model that explains the effects of regulation on the organization of MIS. Second, we evaluate the proposed research model by conducting an empirical study with 105 highly experienced respondents and apply a SEM-PLS approach. In summary, the results provide evidence that the degree of regulation is positively associated to both executive commitment to regulatory compliance and involvement of legal experts in IS compliance projects.","['Compliance', 'Contingency Theory', 'Law', 'MIS', 'Regulation']",,en

By applying standardization theory we seek to explain the outcomes in each of the cases. At an empirical level, our data show that both solutions are viable options and gateways can become functionally equivalent to standards.

We present and analyse empirical data from a case in which electronic ordering in the Australian pharmaceutical industry evolved over a 30 year period from closed to quasiopen systems. We analyse this revelatory case using a practice-theoretical framework to make visible the phenomenon of IOIS evolution. An essential characteristic of this framework is the distinction between and symmetrical treatment of material, normative and ideational structures within the practices that constitute the IOIS. Against the findings of this case study, we then evaluate two promising models of long term IS change, namely Porra's (1999) Colonial Systems model and Lyytinen and Newman's (2008) Punctuated Socio-technical IS Change model. These models are selected as highly elaborated IS exemplars of two classes of theories of organizational change, namely evolutionary and dialectical theories. We find that these two models can only partially explain our findings. Finally, we make suggestions for developing more comprehensive theoretical models within these two classes of IS change theories. In practical terms, our paper shows that the transformation from closed to open IOIS may require adoption of longer timeframes than are usually assumed and closer attention to norms and rationales usually neglected in IS projects.","['Colonial Systems model', 'inter-organizational information systems (IOIS)', 'long-term IS change', 'practice theory', 'Punctuated Socio-technical IS Change model', 'systems evolution']","['Approximation algorithms, Classification, Feature selection, Local search, Prediction, Traveling salesperson problem']",en

While there are often positive effects attributed with the trend, e.g. with respect to increased performance or motivation, not much attention has yet been given to the effects it has on stress of employees. In order to close this research gap, we conduct a qualitative single case study in the public sector. We derive four major stressors that are related to IT consumerization, i.e. 1) increased reachability, 2) lack of competence, 3) workflow changes, and 4) system redundancies. These stressors are discussed with respect to related theory concepts in IS. Moreover, they are used to derive recommendations for practitioners with respect to policy development and communication.

Additionally, they provide management functions like e.g. mining, querying, merging and variants management for process models. However, most current business process management repositories are built on top of relation database management systems (RDBMS) although this leads to performance issues. These issues result from the relational algebra, the mismatch between relational tables and object oriented programming (impedance mismatch) as well as new technological developments in the last 30 years as e.g. more and cheap disk and memory space, clusters and clouds. The goal of this paper is to present current paradigms to overcome the performance problems inherent in RDBMS. Therefore, we have to fuse research about data modeling along database technologies as well as algorithm design and parallelization for the technology paradigms occurring nowadays. Based on these research streams we have shown how the performance of business process management repositories could be improved in terms of loading performance of processes (from e.g. a disk) and the computation of management techniques resulting in even faster application of such a technique.

Our DSSP concept is founded upon a set of four sequential activities: sensing digital social signals that are emitted by individuals on social media; decoding online data of social media in order to reconstruct digital social signals; matching the signals with consumers' life events; and configuring individualized goods and service offerings tailored to the individual needs of customers.

21362400,Online Convergence Detection for Multiobjective Aerodynamic Applications,"Industry applications of multiobjective optimization problems mostly are characterized by the demand for high quality solutions on the one hand. On the other hand an optimization result is desired which at any rate meets the time constraints for the evolutionary multiobjective algorithms (EMOA). The handling of this trade-off is a frequently discussed issue in multiobjective evolutionary optimization. Recently an online convergence detection algorithm (OCD) for EMOA based on statistical testing has been introduced. OCD is independent from any knowledge of the true Pareto front of the optimization problem. It automatically stops at the EMOA generation in which either only a very small variation or a trend stagnation of a set of multiobjective performance indicators are detected for a predefined number of generations. In the course of the paper, OCD is applied to two aerodynamic test cases provided by a global player of the aircraft industry. It is shown that OCD performs extremely well on these problems in terms of saved function evaluations and EMOA performance after the OCD stop generation. © 2009 IEEE.",,,en
21362483,Pareto-Dominance in Noisy Environments,Noisy environments are a challenging task for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The algorithms may be trapped in local optima or even become a random search in the decision and objective space. In the course of the paper the classical definition of Pareto-dominance is enhanced subject to noisy objective functions in order to make the evolutionary search process more robust and to generate a reliable Pareto front. At each point in the decision space the objective functions are evaluated a fixed number of times and the convex hull of the objective function vectors is computed. Expectation is associated with the median of the objective function values while uncertainty is reflected by the average distance of the median in each dimension to the points defining the convex hull. By combining these two indicators a new concept of Pareto-dominance is set up. An implementation in NSGA-II and application to test problems show a gain in robustness andsearch quality. © 2009 IEEE.,,"['BBOB test set, Benchmarking, Evolutionary optimization, Exploratory Landscape Analysis, Fitness landscape']",

21363036,Introducing User Preference Using Desirability Functions in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimisation of Noisy Processes,"Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are generally designed to find a well spread Pareto-front approximation. Often, only a small section of this front may be of practical interest. Desirability Functions (DFs) are able to describe user preferences intuitively. Furthermore, DFs can be attached to any fitness function easily. This way, desirability functions can help in guiding MOEAs without introducing additional restrictions or changes to the algorithm. The application of noisy fitness functions is not straight forward but relevant to many real-world problems. Therefore, a variant of Harrington's one-sided desirability function using expectations is introduced which takes noise into account.

We would then be interested in the algorithm that performs best in a majority of cases or whose average performance is maximal. We will focus on evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOA), and will present a novel approach to the design and analysis of evolutionary multiobjective benchmark experiments based on similar work from the context of machine learning.

21363192,Integration of Preferences in Hypervolume-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms by Means of Desirability Functions,"In this paper, a concept for efficiently approximating the practically relevant regions of the Pareto front (PF) is introduced. Instead of the original objectives, desirability functions (DFs) of the objectives are optimized, which express the preferences of the decision maker. The original problem formulation and the optimization algorithm do not have to be modified. DFs map an objective to the domain $[0, 1]$ and nonlinearly increase with better objective quality. By means of this mapping, values of different objectives and units become comparable. A biased distribution of the solutions in the PF approximation based on different scalings of the objectives is prevented. Thus, we propose the integration of DFs into the S-metric selection evolutionary multiobjective algorithm. The transformation ensures the meaning of the hypervolumes internally computed. Furthermore, it is shown that the reference point for the hypervolume calculation can be set intuitively. The approach is analyzed using standard test problems.

Convergence is measured by the performance indicators Generational Distance, Spread and Hypervolume. The stochastic nature of the MOEA is taken into account by repeated runs per generation number which results in a highly robust procedure. For each generation number the MOEA is repeated a fixed number of times, and the Kolmogorow-Smirnov-Test is used in order to decide if a significant change in performance is gained in comparison to preceding generations. A comparison of different MOEAs on a problem with respect to necessary generation numbers becomes possible, and the understanding of the algorithm's behaviour is supported by analysing the development of the indicator values.

21364385,OCD: Online Convergence Detection for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Algorithms Based on Statistical Testing,"Over the last decades, evolutionary algorithms (EA) have proven their applicability to hard and complex industrial optimization problems in many cases. However, especially in cases with high computational demands for fitness evaluations (FE), the number of required FE is often seen as a drawback of these techniques. This is partly due to lacking robust and reliable methods to determine convergence, which would stop the algorithm before useless evaluations are carried out. To overcome this drawback, we define a method for online convergence detection (OCD) based on statistical tests, which invokes a number of performance indicators and which can be applied on a stand-alone basis (no predefined Pareto fronts, ideal and reference points). Our experiments show the general applicability of OCD by analyzing its performance for different algorithmic setups and on different classes of test functions. Furthermore, we show that the number of FE can be reduced considerably - compared to common suggestions from literature - without significantly deteriorating approximation accuracy. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,,

The proposed techniques fulfill the requirements of proper statistical assessment on the one hand and efficient optimisation for real-world problems on the other hand. The first approach accounts for the stochastic nature of the MOEA by repeating the optimisation runs for increasing generation numbers and analysing the performance indicators using statistical tools. This technique results in a very robust offline procedure. Moreover, an online convergence detection method is introduced as well. This method automatically stops the MOEA when either the variance of the performance indicators falls below a specified threshold or a stagnation of their overall trend is detected. Both methods are analysed and compared for two MOEA and on different classes of benchmark functions.

Furthermore, a variant of OCD is introduced which directly operates on the hypervolume indicator - the internal measure of the SMS-EMOA. This allows a separated analysis of the variance criterion and reduces the complexity of OCD. Based on the experimental design, a systematic comparison with the classical OCD approach is performed and differences between the appropriate parameterizations of both variants are highlighted. © 2010 IEEE.",,"['social media', ' manager', ' Mintzberg', ' manager roles']",
21364697,On the Distribution of EMOA Hypervolumes,"In recent years, new approaches for multi-modal and multiobjective stochastic optimisation have been developed. It is a rather normal process that these experimental fields develop independently from other scientific areas. However, the connection between stochastic optimisation and statistics is obvious and highly appreciated. Recent works, such as sequential parameter optimisation (SPO, cf. Bartz-Beielstein [1]) or online convergence detection (OCD, cf. Trautmann et al [2]), have combined methods from evolutionary computation and statistics. One important aspect in statistics is the analysis of stochastic outcomes of experiments and optimization methods, respectively. To this end, the optimisation runs of different evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithms (EMOA, cf. Deb [3] or Coello Coello et al. [4]) are treated as experiments to analyse the stochastic behavior of the results and to approximate the distribution of the performance of the EMOA. To combine the outcome of an EMOA and receive a single performance indicator value, the hypervolume (HV) indicator is considered, which is the only known unary quality indicator in this field (cf. Zitzler et al. [5]). The paper at hand investigates and compares the HV indicator outcome of multiple runs of two EMOA on different mathematical test cases. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,"['Social Media', ' Stakeholder Communication', ' Stakeholder Relationship Management', ' DAX30', ' NGOs']",
21364777,Preference-Based Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization Using Desirabilities,"The integration of experts' preferences is an important aspect in multi-objective optimization. Usually, one out of a set of Pareto optimal solutions has to be chosen based on expert knowledge. A combination of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) with the desirability concept is introduced to efficiently focus on desired and relevant regions of the true Pareto front of the optimization problem which facilitates the solution selection process. Desirability functions of the objectives are optimized, and the desirability index is used for selecting the global best particle in each iteration. The resulting MOPSO variant DF-MOPSO in most cases exclusively generates solutions in the desired area of the Pareto front. Approximations of the whole Pareto front result in cases of misspecified desired regions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","['desirability function', 'desirability index', 'MOPSO', 'Particle swarm optimization', 'preferences']","['social media', ' adoption', ' global', ' life cycle', ' network effects']",

We propose new, robust selection strategies for evolutionary multi-objective optimization in the presence of noise. We apply new measures of uncertainty for estimating the recently introduced Pareto-dominance for uncertain and noisy environments (PDU). The first measure is the inter-quartile range of the outcomes of repeated function evaluations. The second is based on axis-aligned bounding boxes around the upper and lower quantiles of the sampled fitness values in objective space.

However, normally only standard techniques are employed by the engineering experts. Here, it is shown how these standard techniques can be completed and improved with respect to interactivity to other tools, runtime, and parameterization. The coupling with metamodels serves as an example for the interactivity to other tools, while the online convergence detection relates to runtime, i.e. stopping criteria. Finally, sequential parameter optimization improves results focussing on parameter tuning. We show that invoking all these methods on their own already enhances EMOAs for aerodynamic applications. It is concluded with an outlook on how these methods might come together to foster aerospace applications and, at a time, widen the application area to multi-disciplinary optimization tasks. © 2011, SAGE Publications.

21365095,On the Properties of the R2 Indicator,"In multiobjective optimization, set-based performance indicators are commonly used to assess the quality of a Pareto front approximation. Based on the scalarization obtained by these indicators, a performance comparison of multiobjective optimization algorithms becomes possible. The R2 and the Hypervolume (HV) indicator represent two recommended approaches which have shown a correlated behavior in recent empirical studies. Whereas the HV indicator has been comprehensively analyzed in the last years, almost no studies on the R2 indicator exist. In this paper, we thus perform a comprehensive investigation of the properties of the R2 indicator in a theoretical and empirical way. The influence of the number and distribution of the weight vectors on the optimal distribution of μ solutions is analyzed. Based on a comparative analysis, specific characteristics and differences of the R2 and HV indicator are presented. © 2012 ACM.","['hypervolume indicator', 'multiobjective optimization', 'performance assessment', 'r2 indicator']",,
21365174,Finding evenly spaced fronts for multiobjective control via averaging Hausdorff-measure,"Recently, it was proposed to use the averaged Hausdorff distance Δ p as a performance indicator for evolutionary multiobjective algorithms (EMOAs). To be more precise, it was proposed to measure the respective distance of the image of the outcome set script O sign of an EMOA to the image of the solution set of a given multiobjective optimization problem (MOP), the so-called Pareto front F. The main advantage of this approach is that the Δ p value gives a clear idea of the approximation quality of script O sign to F in terms of both convergence and spread. Furthermore, Δ p is not as sensitive to outliers as the classical Hausdorff distance d H which is a potential drawback of d H when using stochastic search algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms. Here we make a first attempt to design an EMOA which aims for low Δ p values. The challenge is that the Pareto front is of course a priori not known. Instead, we compute approximations of F by linearizing the nondominated front of the current population which we utilize for the selection mechanism. This leads to an EMOA where the images of script O sign are evenly spread along F which is in particular advantageous for multiobjective control problems. We test the novel algorithm on some benchmark problems including comparisons to NSGAII. © 2011 IEEE.","['averaged Hausdorff distance', 'dominated hypervolume', 'multiobjective control', 'SMS-EMOA']","['Column store', ' Optimierung', ' Late materialization', ' Block iteration', ' Star schema benchmark', ' Kompression']",

21367356,Demographic Awareness and E-Government - A Quantitative Analysis of Germany and Japan,"Innovating public administrations, for instance by means of E-Government, becomes an increasingly important issue in order to satisfy growing demands of citizens and to reduce costs of public service provision. Demographic change in industrialized countries, namely societal aging and depopulation, has various influences on the development of E-Government strategies. On the one hand, elderly citizens use services of their local government more often than people of younger age-groups. On the other hand, they are less likely to use complex electronic services in general and E-Government in specific. In addition, municipalities have to deal with increased cost pressure and the aging of the workforce within their local administrations as a result of the demographic change. Our quantitative analysis focuses on identifying the perceived importance of problems related to the demographic change in German and Japanese public administrations, addresses what areas of reform are related to these problems and points out implications for the development of innovation strategies by means of E-Government. We contrast the developments in both countries with respect to both demographic situation and public innovation in order to derive possible implications for the future.","['Demographic change', 'E-Government', 'E-Inclusion', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Public Innovation']",,en

However, motivational as-pects in blended learning have not been sufficiently researched yet.

We selected &ldquo;likes&rdquo; as a non-monetary incentive and ena-bled students to rate other students&rsquo; posts (similar to Facebook). In a second turn, a monetary incentive (a tablet PC or the cash equivalent, respectively) was raffled among the students of a top 10 &ldquo;like&rdquo;-ranking. Based on log-file data and survey results, we observe that both variations ((1) only &ldquo;likes&rdquo; and (2) &ldquo;likes&rdquo; &amp; tablet PC prize) do not differ with respect of their influence on the overall activity of learners during the lecture. Thus, the additional monetary in-centive did not increase activity.

21376335,Usability Of Virtual Worlds,"Abstract. In recent years virtual worlds left their origins driven by new technologies. Following, 3D-based environments moved into business related domains and are used e.g. to support virtual meetings or product presentations. However, enterprises have to consider that large share of companies' employees still fit to the definition of so-called digital immigrants. While younger employees are familiar with the usage of 3D-based environments, navigating in virtual rooms might be challenging for digital immigrants. This could limit the usage of virtual worlds for business related contexts. Therefore, we conducted usability tests with digital immigrants in virtual worlds and investigated their experiences. Our results show that in fact digital immigrants face problems when using virtual worlds. Based upon our study we discuss how to improve usability of virtual worlds for this group of users.",Virtual worlds; usability; digital immigrants,"['Bayes rule', ' Bellman equation', ' contractive operators', ' Howard algorithm', ' policy improvement routine', ' sequentially planned tests', ' simple hypothesis testing']",en
21384136,Counter-Forensics: Attacking Image Forensics,"This chapter discusses counter-forensics, the art and science of impeding or misleading forensic analyses of digital images. Research on counter-forensics is motivated by the need to assess and improve the reliability of forensic methods in situations where intelligent adversaries make efforts to induce a certain outcome of forensic analyses. Counter-forensics is first defined in a formal decision-theoretic framework. This framework is then interpreted and extended to encompass the requirements to forensic analyses in practice, including a discussion of the notion of authenticity in the presence of legitimate processing, and the role of image models with regard to the epistemic underpinning of the forensic decision problem. A terminology is developed that distinguishes security from robustness properties, integrated from post-processing attacks, and targeted from universal attacks. This terminology is directly applied in a self-contained technical survey of counter-forensics against image forensics, notably techniques that suppress traces of image processing and techniques that synthesize traces of authenticity, including examples and brief evaluations. A discussion of relations to other domains of multimedia security and an overview of open research questions concludes the chapter.",,"['Acceptance sampling', ' backward induction', ' Bayes procedures', ' multistage decision procedures', ' quality control']",en

21391696,Adoption and Use of Social Media in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises,"In recent years, social media have been increasingly adopted in enterprises. Enterprises use social media as an additional way to get in contact with their customers and support internal communication and collaboration. However, little research is devoted to the adoption and internal usage of social media in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are of high social and economic importance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the adoption, usage, and benefits of social media in SMEs as well as potential concerns that may prevent a wider adoption of social media in SMEs. Therefore, a survey of decision-makers in German SMEs was conducted. Findings based on 190 responses indicate that SMEs started to use internal social media (e.g., wikis, blogs) in order to support collaboration among employees and to improve knowledge management. However, SMEs still face problems to manage adoption and to identify relevant business values. Based on our results, we derive several implications for SMEs, in particular how to overcome the obstacles to a wider adoption of social media.",social media; SME; adoption; usage; LSE; internal; unternehmensintern,,en

We consider three forms of exposure: directly falling victim, expressing concern about security, and reading news reports. We find that directly experiencing cybercrime decreases the likelihood of shopping and banking online by 4-5 percentage points. We find that expressing concern about cybercrime has nearly twice as much negative impact on online behavior than directly experiencing cybercrime. People who have not heard anything about cybercrime in news reports or from colleagues are more likely to bank online than those who have heard such reports.

We study the case of n-bit covers, independently but not identically distributed to allow for variation in the predictability between parts of the cover. The defender knows the predictability exactly and chooses k embedding positions. The attacker may obtain side information to predict one chosen position of the cover and compare it to the observed object to make a decision.

For each of the main categories of cybercrime we set out what is and is not known of the direct costs, indirect costs and defence costs – both to the UK and to the world as a whole. We distinguish carefully between traditional crimes that are now “cyber” because they are conducted online (such as tax and welfare fraud); transitional crimes whose modus operandi has changed substantially as a result of the move online (such as credit card fraud); new crimes that owe their existence to the Internet; and what we might call platform crimes such as the provision of botnets which facilitate other crimes rather than being used to extract money from victims directly. As far as direct costs are concerned, we find that traditional offences such as tax and welfare fraud cost the typical citizen in the low hundreds of pounds/euros/dollars a year; transitional frauds cost a few pounds/euros/dollars; while the new computer crimes cost in the tens of pence/cents. However, the indirect costs and defence costs are much higher for transitional and new crimes. For the former they may be roughly comparable to what the criminals earn, while for the latter they may be an order of magnitude more. As a striking example, the botnet behind a third of the spam sent in 2010 earned its owners around $2.7 million, while worldwide expenditures on spam prevention probably exceeded a billion dollars. We are extremely inefficient at fighting cybercrime; or to put it another way, cyber-crooks are like terrorists or metal thieves in that their activities impose disproportionate costs on society. Some of the reasons for this are well-known: cybercrimes are global and have strong externalities, while traditional crimes such as burglary and car theft are local, and the associated equilibria have emerged after many years of optimisation. As for the more direct question of what should be done, our figures suggest that we should spend less in anticipation of cybercrime (on antivirus, firewalls, etc.) and more in response – that is, on the prosaic business of hunting down cyber-criminals and throwing them in jail.",,"['Humanitäre Logistik', ' Humanitäre Hilfe', ' Logistik', ' Informationssysteme']",en
21516999,A Game-Theoretic Approach to Content-Adaptive Steganography,"Content-adaptive embedding is widely believed to improve steganographic security over uniform random embedding. However, such security claims are often based on empirical results using steganalysis methods not designed to detect adaptive embedding. We propose a framework for content-adaptive embedding in the case of imperfect steganography. It formally defines heterogeneity within the cover as a necessary condition for adaptive embedding. We devise a game-theoretic model for the whole process including cover generation, adaptive embedding, and a detector which anticipates the adaptivity. Our solution exhibits a unique equilibrium in mixed strategies. Its location depends on the level of heterogeneity of the cover source, but never coincides with naïve adaptive embedding. The model makes several simplifying assumptions, including independent cover symbols and the steganalyst's ability to recover the adaptivity criterion perfectly. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","['Content-Adaptive Steganography', 'Game Theory', 'Security']",,de

21517235,The Security Cost of Cheap User Interaction,"Human attention is a scarce resource, and lack thereof can cause severe security breaches. As most security techniques rely on considerate human intervention in one way or another, this resource should be consumed economically. In this context, we postulate the view that every false alarm or unnecessary user interaction imposes a negative externality on all other potential consumers of this chunk of attention. The paper identifies incentive problems that stimulate overconsumption of human attention in security applications. It further outlines a lump-of-attention model, devised against the backdrop of established theories in the behavioral sciences, and discusses incentive mechanisms to fix the misallocation problem in security notification, for instance the idea of a Pigovian tax on attention consumption. © 2011 ACM.","['attention economics', 'bounded rationality', 'HCI', 'interdisciplinary security and privacy', 'notice and consent', 'policy', 'security economics', 'security warnings', 'usable security']",,en
21517388,Security Investment with Penetration Testing,"Penetration testing, the deliberate search for potential vulnerabilities in a system by using attack techniques, is a relevant tool of information security practitioners. This paper adds penetration testing to the realm of information security investment. Penetration testing is modeled as an information gathering option to reduce uncertainty in a discrete time, finite horizon, player-versus-nature, weakest-link security game. We prove that once started, it is optimal to continue penetration testing until a secure state is reached. Further analysis using a new metric for the return on penetration testing suggests that penetration testing almost always increases the per-dollar efficiency of security investment. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,,en
21517465,Security Games with Market Insurance,"Security games are characterized by multiple players who strategically adjust their defenses against an abstract attacker, represented by realizations of nature. The defense strategies include both actions where security generates positive externalities and actions that do not. When the players are assumed to be risk averse, market insurance enters as a third strategic option. We formulate a one-shot security game with market insurance, characterize its pure equilibria, and describe how the equilibria compare to established results. Simplifying assumptions include homogeneous players, fair insurance premiums, and complete information except for realizations of nature. The results add more realism to the interpretation of analytical models of security games and might inform policy makers on adjusting incentives to improve network security and foster the development of a market for cyber-insurance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","['Externalities', 'Game theory', 'Market insurance', 'Protection', 'Security', 'Self-insurance']",,en

Building on the counter-forensics algorithm by Stamm et al. [1], we point out a vulnerability in this scheme when a maximum likelihood estimator has no solution. We construct a targeted detector against it, and present an improved scheme which uses imputation to deal with cases that lack an estimate. While this scheme is secure against our targeted detector, it is detectable by a further improved detector, which borrows from steganalysis and uses a calibrated feature. All claims are backed with experimental results from 2 × 800 never-compressed never-resampled grayscale images. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","['Counter-Forensics', 'Image Forensics', 'JPEG Compression']",,en

We frame this finding in the theory of descriptive social norms and analyze moderating effects, such as similarity of context, social proximity, and mimicry of success factors. The presence of peer effects in disclosure behavior can explain the formation and change of apparent social norms and attitudes towards privacy. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,,en
21572428,Towards a Reference Model of Information Exchange and Coordination in Facility Management Networks,"An efficient and effective management of facilities requires considering all the product and services related to a building’s entire life at an early stage. The interdisciplinary Facility Management (FM) approach advocates accordant concepts and techniques with the intention to reduce the total costs of facilities. A successful FM needs to bring together several actors involved in planning and operating a facility in a network organization. The specification of information flows and coordination mechanisms between these actors is complex, and in this paper we argue that reference models can speed-up this process. We elaborated more than 50 process models that uncover the interaction in FM service networks through interviews and workshops with practitioners. This research-in-progress develops a reference model of the interactions between conventional construction enterprises and specific FM service providers based on this empirical data following an iterative research process.","['Facility Management', 'Consulting', 'Service Networks', 'Reference Model', 'Information Flow Models']",,en

However, current research lacks appropriatemethods guiding practitioners in successfullyimplementing these measures. As implementingflexibility in most cases comes along with an increasein costs, the decisions which flexibility measures toimplement require a trade-off between the benefitgained from an increased flexibility, and the costswhich apply. The purpose of this paper is to provide afirst approach to evaluating this trade-off usingdiscrete event simulation.The concept is presented and evaluated by meansof a practical scenario from the table-top productmanufacturing industry using the adjustment ofproduction lot sizes and safety stock levels as exampleflexibility measures.

21599019,Walking a Tightrope: Managing Paradoxes and Tensions between Care taking and Efficiency through IT-enabled Organizational Transformation in a Hospital Group,"The healthcare sector in general and hospitals in particular are often portrayed as lagging behind in terms of organizational efficiency. Management is facing the challenge to introduce economic principles to guide the caregiving processes of their organization. In contrast to management, healthcare profes- sionals are primarily concerned with patient care and increasingly perceive economic constraints as compromising their work. Information and communi- cation technology has been heralded as a panaceum to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce cost at the same time. This paper aims for studying the role of management in accommodating the tensions caused by the conflicting logics of care taking and efficiency. It uses the introduction of a centralized pharmacy and electronic ordering system in a German hospital (group) as an illustrative case. In doing so this paper portrays the careful maneuvering of management in order to mitigate and overcome the tension between economic and medical logic. It shows how management translates regulatory con- straints into accepted rules and mechanisms that facilitate quality of care and productivity at the same time.",,,en
21599096,Exploring Methods for Investigating Technostress in Situ: Understanding the Day and the Life of a Knowledge Worker Using Heart Rate Variability,"The proliferation of information and communication technology (ICT) throughout workplace and home life is thought to increase feelings of being overloaded, drained, and/or burned out. This phenomenon is termed &ldquo;technostress.&rdquo; In this relatively new line of research, scholars have employed predominantly questionnaire surveys and experiments to investigate the phenomenon. This paper argues for an interpretive, theory building approach for studying technostress, motivated by two shortcomings of these data collection techniques: questionnaire surveys rely on potentially imperfect participant recall, while experiments cannot find root causes of technostress during the course of a normal work day. Linking periods of bodily-experienced stress measured by heart rate variability with qualitative data enables an interpretive, theory building approach that allows for a richer understanding of whether and how ICT contributes to stress.",,,en
21599173,The struggle for 'appropriateness' - new sources of (techno-)stress ,"Information and communication technologies are employed in every aspect of contemporary life. Facilitated by ICT, many innovations in the organization of work have taken hold. The effects of these developments on the quality of life are disputed. By referring to the phenomenon of &lsquo;technostress,&rsquo; scholars&rsquo; caution against potentially harmful effects of ICT on workers&rsquo; health. This relatively new line of research roots the sources of stress for the individual in features of ICT. The present paper is motivated by the observation that ICT is also rooted in social relations. The way it is used is heavily influenced by social norms and sensemaking. Based on this, the paper theorizes about new sources of stress originating from the social sphere that are enabled and facilitated by ICT. In particular, the paper investigates the notion of &lsquo;appropriateness&rsquo; as a theoretical building block for a more complex understanding of stress in today&rsquo;s workplaces. In doing so, the paper seeks to establish a new theoretical framework capable of investigating new sources of stress on a theoretical as well as empirical level.",,,en

Thereby, the traditional infrastructure has been drastically reformed and an innovative infrastructure model has been created instead.

BPM experts are exposed to communication processes involving people from various backgrounds (e.g., various business areas, fields of expertise, and cultures). Research in applied linguistics has shown that it is difficult to plan for constellations of such communication processes; thus, agile communication skills are vital for successful business communication. Teaching programs for BPM, however, do not account for these skills. Rather, they mainly address methods for the analysis, implementation, and management of business processes. As a result, graduates&mdash;though they may be technically and methodologically apt&mdash;face unexpected challenges due to communication deficiencies in BPM projects. BPM research has shown that deficiencies in communication are in fact among the most frequent reasons for project failure.

We wanted to find out whether apps are interesting for all businesses, how they think apps can be useful for them, in which way they consider to use them, and what kinds of challenges and problems they see. Therefore, we worked with local companies and conducted interviews. By analysing the transcripts we got detailed insights of the practial relevance of using apps. We present the status quo of app development by local companies, highlight early best practices described by them, and discuss our findings. Thereby, we raise topics for future research.

21629844,A Review and Classification of Measures to Adjust Supply Chain Flexibility,"The ability of a supply chain to flexibly cope with an increasingly volatile business environment is a key to responsiveness towards unexpected changes such as varying customer demand. A major question in this context is how a supply chain's level of flexibility can be adjusted. It was found that a lot of research, although explicitly dealing with flexibility, lacks an overview of concrete flexibility measures. This research paper seeks to support filling this gap by providing a literature review as well as a characterization and classification of measures to adjust supply chain flexibility. The review focuses on literature from the flexibility domain, but also covers contributions targeting the robustness, agility, and adaptivity of supply chains as well as supply chain risk management. A scheme for characterization is suggested which builds on attributes that need to be considered when thinking about the application of such flexibility measures in practice. It includes (amongst others) the costs and lead times for the setup and utilization of flexibility measures, and the types of flexibility impacted by their application. Flexibility measures are described and characterized according to this scheme, and a classification which builds on these attributes is established.",,,en

XML has been identified by many as a prominent technology for enabling electronic supply chain integration, but the adoption of it in the industry has been rather slow and limited. This paper discusses the factors that enable agility in supply chains, and explains why XML is the best candidate for facilitating such factors. Then the major XML-based integration initiatives such as ebXML, RosettaNet, and Web Services are diagnosed in terms of their pros and cons for supply chain agility, as well as the reasons for their slow diffusion. Based on the discussion, this paper proposes that: the integration efforts need to first focus on the industries that need agility; stringent business process standards are necessary; and implementation should be made much easier and more affordable for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

21771748,The Digital Divide Vs. The E-Government Divide: Do Socio-Demographic Variables (Still) Impact E-Government Use Among Onliners,"E-government is beneficial for both citizens and public administrations. However, there are great differences in citizens&rsquo; e-government usage and, thus, there exists a gap between adopters and non-adopters of e-government services. Most related studies explore e-government acceptance on the basis of the entire population, while investigation of onliners rarely takes place. However, being online is a necessary pre-requisite for consuming Internet-based e-government services. Against the background that the number of Internet users is increasing steadily, the authors identify the need to differentiate general Internet adoption (digital divide) effects and e-government-specific divide effects. In the study, they develop a research framework, where the cumulative effect of e-government adoption (among all people) is split into (1) the digital divide effect and (2) the e-government divide effect (among Internet users). The authors derive three corresponding research models and examine the influence of socio-demographic factors: age, gender, income, and education. They test the research framework using comprehensive survey data (n = 1930). Analysis of the results justifies the separation of the e-government divide effect from the cumulative effect of e-government adoption, because the factors influencing e-government usage among the entire population and among onliners are proved to be different. Implications for theory and recommendations for practice are discussed. The findings reveal two important success factors for e-government: citizens&rsquo; Internet literacy and e-government services targeted at lesser-educated citizens.",,"['Digital Divide, E-Inclusion, Quantitative Study, UTAUT']",en

Insufficient maintenance may induce downtimes with significant effects on operators' costs, profits and customer service perception. However, guaranteeing a high maintenance service-level may lead to immoderate running costs exceeding the intended benefits.

21878930,Emotions and Information Diffusion in Social Media - Sentiment of Microblogs and Sharing Behavior,"As a new communication paradigm, social media has promoted information dissemination in social networks. Previous research has identified several content-related features as well as user and network characteristics that may drive information diffusion. However, little research has focused on the relationship between emotions and information diffusion in a social media setting. In this paper, we examine whether sentiment occurring in social media content is associated with a user's information sharing behavior. We carry out our research in the context of political communication on Twitter. Based on two data sets of more than 165,000 tweets in total, we find that emotionally charged Twitter messages tend to be retweeted more often and more quickly compared to neutral ones.

21881765,Cooperative Community Clouds for Small and Medium Enterprises,"Cloud computing, or more generally cloud services, ought to be particularly attractive for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). According to expert opinion, these enterprises should be able to benefit over proportionally from outsourced IT services due to a variety of reasons. As of today, however, many SMEs still refrain from adopting cloud services because they do not trust the cloud service provider sufficiently and they cannot assess the legal implications of using cloud services. In this paper, we present an argument in favor of a cooperative community cloud that applies the paradigm of a cooperative to cloud operations. We sketch our vision of a "" trustworthy"" cloud, argue for its viability, and identify areas for future research.","['Cloud computing', 'Cloud services', 'Community cloud', 'Cooperative', 'Small and medium enterprises']",,en

Starting with the actual IT situation, we show the prerequisites as well as the reasons in favor of and against the use of SaaS. We then show that the views of SMEs differ in some significant respects from that of CSPs, and we deduce hypotheses that can help towards a better design and delivery of cloud software and services.","['Cloud Computing', 'SaaS', 'Small and Medium Enterprises', 'SME', 'Software-as-a-Service']","['Business Process Management, Collaboration, Innovation Networks, Public Sector, Quantitative Study']",en
21881933,A Case for Cooperative Cloud Intermediaries for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,"Cloud computing is a new and increasingly popular form of IT outsourcing. It implies that a cloud service provider offers very standardized abstract IT services which are accessed by a user over the Internet. While cloud services are supposed to be very beneficial for small and medium-sized enterprises, the adoption of such services has been low in this group, among other reasons because of high complexity of the cloud market and trust concerns. This paper motivates the notion of cooperative cloud intermediaries as a solution for these concerns by building on well-known concepts: transaction cost theory, agency theory, the notion of intermediaries in electronic markets and the cooperative paradigm. We derive our solution in detail and show its viability in theory.",,,en

Following those studies, this will definitely change the working environment and confront CIOs with new challenges. In order to identify how IT business values could be generated in a mobile enterprise, we analyzed survey data of 192 CIOs and managers of large German companies. Furthermore, we gathered data on the mobile communication behavior of 40 ""road warriors"". We identified specific management activities within the mobile IT conversion and use process which lead to a higher organizational performance. Among others, aspects such as supporting unified communication, mobile business process management, ""bring your own device"" (BYOD), as well as security issues play a major role. Based on a comprehensive model of mobile IT business value creation and our dataset, we derived recommendations for CIOs how to manage the transformation process into a mobile enterprise",Mobile enterprise success factors; mobile business value; road warriors; framework; transformation process,,en
21894317,Collaborative Media Choice Processes in Virtual Teams,"Download CitationEmailPrintRequest Permissions  Virtual teams have become a common form of organizing work. A vital part of virtual collaboration is the process of choosing appropriate media and subsequently adopting it. Up to now, research has mainly focused on giving guidelines for or predicting media usage in virtual teams ignoring how teams come to use their media. Furthermore, only the individual media choice is analyzed whereas the collaborative use is hardly studied. The goal of our study therefore was to understand how virtual teams collaboratively choose their collaboration and communication media. Media choice theories that explain media choices and media behaviors served as a theoretical underpinning. We conducted a case study with fifteen teams (33 participants in total) taking part in an international virtual seminar. Qualitative data were gathered from presentations held by the seminar participants, from field notes taken by the researchers as well as from semi-structured interviews, conducted with seven participants. Following an adopted grounded theory approach, we derived seven theses, which we structured according to the categories (1) criteria for media choice, (2) the media choice process, and (3) overcoming the deficiencies in virtual collaborations. This case study gives a rich description about the media choice process in virtual teams as well as factors influencing it.","['case study', 'media choice', 'media choice theories', 'virtual collaboration']",,en

21896368,IT Consumerization – A Theory and Practice Review,"Consumerization of IT refers to privately-owned IT resources, such as devices or software that are used for business purposes. The effects of consumerization are considered to be a major driver that redefines the relationship between employees (in terms of consumers of enterprise IT) and the IT organization. While there has been extensive debate on these matters in practice, IS research has not developed a clear theoretical understanding of the phenomenon. We present a theory and practice review, where the existing literature on consumerization is reviewed and a clear definition of the concept is developed. This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of IT consumerization in relation to fundamental aspects of IS. Our analysis shows, first, which distinct aspects of IS are affected by consumerization. Secondly, we provide an overview over major advantages and disadvantages for employees and organizations by conducting a systematic analysis of current literature available on the topic. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","['Consumer IT', 'Consumerization', 'Information systems', 'Theory review']",,en

The E-Government Divide: Do Socio-Demographic Variables (Still) Impact E-Government Use Among Onliners?,"E-Government brings mutual benefits to both citizens and public administrations. However, there exists a gap between adopters and non-adopters of e-Government services. Most studies in this field explore e-Government acceptance on the basis of the entire population, while investigation of onliners rarely takes place. Against the background that the number of internet users is increasing steadily, we identify the need to differentiate general internet adoption (digital divide) effects and e-Government-specific divide effects. In our study, we thus develop a research framework, where the cumulative effect of e-Government adoption (among all people) is split into a) the digital divide effect and b) the e-Government divide effect (among internet users). We derive three corresponding research models and examine the influence of socio-demographic factors: age, gender, income, and education. We test our research framework using comprehensive survey data (n = 1930). Analysis of our results justifies the separation of the e-Government divide effect from the cumulative effect of e-Government adoption, because the factors influencing e-Government usage among the entire population and among onliners are proved to be different.

Theory Development and Policy Recommendations for Inclusive E‐Government,"Digital divide is still a big topic in information systems and e-government research. In the past, several tracks and workshops on this topic existed. As information technology and especially the internet become more and more important governments cannot ignore the fact that elderly citizens are excluded from the benefits related to internet usage. Although e-Inclusion programmes and initiatives changed over the years and, moreover, although the amount of e-Inclusion literature is constantly growing, there is still no thorough understanding of potential factors influencing private internet usage. Hence, in this study we identify important influencing factors based on the literature on technology acceptance and digital divide. We develop a model based on these factors and test it against comprehensive survey data (n=192). Our theoretical model is able to explain more than 70% of the variation in private internet usage.

21913058,The Age-Divide in Private Internet Usage: A Quantitative Study of Technology Acceptance,"In today&rsquo;s information society internet usage and e-literacy become more and more important. However, inequalities in internet usage of different social groups become and stay observable. Here, especially elderly citizens, with an increasing share of population in western societies, are often included from benefits related to information technology and internet usage. One important aspect of local governments&rsquo; policy is to bridge this so-called digital divide. However, up to now a thorough understanding of potential factors influencing private internet usage is not provided by the literature. Hence, this paper aims at identifying important influencing factors in order to explain senior citizens&rsquo; private internet use. Thus, we develop a model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and digital divide research which is tested against comprehensive survey data (n=192). The combined model is able to explain more than 70% of the variation of private internet use. Major implications for future research and e-Inclusion practice are discussed.","['Digital Divide', 'Quantitative Study', 'UTAUT']",,en
21913142,From Bureaucratic and Quasi‐Market Environments: On the Co‐Evolution of Public Sector Business Process Management,"Business Process Management (BPM) can be viewed as a set of techniques to integrate, build, and reconfigure an organization&rsquo;s business processes for the purpose achieving a fit with the market environment. While business processes are rather stable in low-dynamic markets, the frequency, quality, and importance of process change amplifies with an increase in environmental dynamics. We show that existing designs of public sector BPM might not be able to cope with the mounting frequency and quality of business process change. Our qualitative in-depth case study of a local government suggests that a major cause for such misfit lies in ineffective organizational learning. We contribute to the literature by applying the Dynamic Capability framework to public sector BPM in order to better understand shifts in market dynamics and their consequences for BPM effectiveness. Practitioners find a proposal for identifying, understanding, and reacting to a BPM-misfit and for developing effective BPM strategies.","['Public Sector', 'Business Process Management', 'Dynamic Capabilities', 'Resource-Based View', 'Qualitative Study']",,en

In this research-in-progress paper, informed by the Dynamic Capability Theory of the firm, we develop a theoretical framework that contributes to the understanding of IT-enabled business process change, and elements of the dynamic capabilities that contribute to change success. Specifically, our framework differentiates between baseline and ad-hoc capabilities, and structures these capabilities in the three phases of sensing, seizing, and transformation. An application of our framework in a case setting suggests that baseline capabilities are activated and new ad-hoc capabilities built based on project specific features. Indeed, our framework when applied to two contrasting embedded cases within the same organization reveals the nature of dynamic capabilities that potentially affect IS and process change success. Limitations, plans to complete this research, and directions for future research are discussed.","['BPM', 'Business process management', 'Dynamic capabilities', 'Process change']",,en

However, the elderly are oftenexcluded from benefiting from IT-enabled service delivery: Anage-related digital divide exists. Current research lacksunderstanding what reasons prevent elderly to use the internet.Therefore, this paper examines the intention to use the internet ina private manner among the elderly. For higher explanatory powerwe also included two other age-groups (G1: &lt;40; G2: 40-59;G3: &gt;59). Here, we build a survey instrument based on the Modelof Acceptance of Technology in Households (MATH) and test themodel against comprehensive survey data (n=501).

We contribute to the study of collaborative process innovation by applying a governance theory perspective, in order to understand the factors that impact on collaboration. Our quantitative study of 357 local governments reveals that, with an increasing maturity in process innovation, all types of collaboration (market, network, hierarchy) are increasing in importance. Moreover, we find that, under financial stress, governments tend to involve network partners (e.g. other local governments) in process innovation, while a lack of process management knowledge leads to market-oriented collaboration with consultants. We derive implications for management practice and discuss how the study enhances our understanding of process innovation and collaboration in the public sector.","['Business Process Management', 'Collaboration', 'Innovation Networks', 'Public Sector', 'Quantitative Study']",,en

The competence to successfully pursue such BPM initiatives represents an important capability which is needed by organizations exposed to a dynamic business environment. While the term BPM is omnipresent, research still lacks both a clear understanding and a theoretical framework in order to explain what constitutes BPM capability. To address this research gap, we apply Dynamic Capability Theory as a helpful means to conceptualize BPM. We further build a detailed framework of sub-capabilities we identify to be relevant for BPM based on existing literature.

21950948,IT Support for Business Process Innovation – Architectural Choices and Design Challenges,"For many organizations, business process innovation (BPI) is a crucial factor to ensure competitiveness. BPI can be characterized as a dynamic capability, since it facilitates change in operational processes. Moreover, it involves creative activity, since new and purposeful business processes are created. In this context, choosing and implementing IT tools that are supportive to these two specifics of process innovation can be considered a key success factor for organizations. However, both characteristics lead to challenges concerning the design of a socio-technical system. Companies have to be aware of those challenges in order to make an informed decision on system design. In this paper, we derive and consolidate characteristics of the innovation process.

The previous parts outlined the status-quo of service description research and practice and highlighted by feature comparison that USDL outstands related approaches in various concerns. However, for evaluating the actual worthiness of a modeling language such as USDL, potential users will consider the fit of the language with the contingent influences their organizations have to deal with. To fill this gap, the purpose of this chapter is to identify requirements for a service description language from potential USDL users. The presented research takes a semiotic theory perspective to the design of modeling languages. Through a Delphi study approach, i.e., an anonymous, written multi-stage survey process, the chapter elaborates a set of requirements. The requirements can be used to ex-post test if the features of the USDL actually address the users' needs and to recheck the underlying assumptions of the USDL design and development process.

In our study we attempt to better understand the impact of the growing diffusion of smartphones among politicians on e-participation. We conducted an online survey and asked members of the German federal parliament about their usage of mobile devices in order to interact with citizens.

21958896,The Morphology of Service Bundling Settings,"The purpose of this paper is to advance our understanding of what contextual factors influence the service bundling process in an organizational setting. Although previous literature contains insights into the mechanisms underlying bundling and the artefacts for performing the bundling task itself, the body of knowledge seems to lacks a comprehensive framework for analysing the actual scenario in which the bundling process is performed. This is required as the scenario will influence the bundling method and the IT support. We address this need by designing a morphological box for analysing bundling scenarios in different organizational settings. The factors featured in the box are systematised into a set of four categories of bundling layers which we identify from reviewing literature. The two core layers in the framework are the service bundling on a type level and on an instance level (i.e. configuration). To demonstrate the applicability and utility of the proposed morphological box, we apply it to assess the underlying differences and commonalities of two different bundling scenarios from the B2B and G2C sectors which stress the differences between bundling on a type and instance level. In addition, we identify several prospects for future research that can benefit from the proposed morphological box.","['Co-Creation', 'Configuration', 'Customer Interaction', 'Morphological Box', 'Service Bundling', 'Service Science Management and Engineering']",,en

Second, modeling language constructs are designed as representation of the theoretical lens applied for the analysis. Third, a set of key questions for analyzing the activities contained in a business process model is derived based on kernel theories. Fourth, the method is integrated into the meta model of a business process modeling language. Fifth, the identification itself is performed by analyzing the activities contained in a business process model with the key question.

21959302,Supporting Enterprise Transformation Using a Universal Model Analysis Approach,"Enterprise Architecture Management has been proposed to help organizations in their efforts to flexibly adapt to rapidly changing market environments. Enterprise architectures are described by means of conceptual models depicting, e.g., an enterprise&rsquo;s business processes, its organisational structure, or the data the enterprise needs to manage. Such models are stored in large repositories. Using these repositories to support enterprise transformation processes often requires detecting structural patterns containing particular labels within the model graphs. As an example, consider the case of mergers and acquisitions. Respective patterns could represent specific model fragments that occur frequently within the process models of the merging companies. This paper introduces an approach to analyse conceptual models at a structural and semantic level. In terms of structure, the approach is able to detect patterns within the model graphs. In terms of semantics, the approach is able to detect previously standardized model labels. Its core contribution to enterprise architecture management and transformation is two-fold. First, it is able to analyse conceptual models created in arbitrary modelling languages. Second, it supports a wide variety of pattern-based analysis tasks related to managing change in organisations. The approach is applied in a merger and acquisition scenario to demonstrate its applicability.",Enterprise Architecture; Conceptual Model Analysis; Pattern Matching; Semantic Standardization,"['social media', ' social media analytics', ' framework', ' political communication']",en

21959632,The Legal Perspective on Business to Government Reporting – A Conceptual Modeling Approach and its Application in the Financial Sector,"Business to Government (BtG) Reporting is a much-regarded research field, even more so since the collapse of the world economy. The topic attracts heightened attention from many financial service companies because they are forced to comply with an increasing number of reporting regulations. In particular, methods to design compliant BtG reporting systems are currently considered inadequate in IS research. This paper presents a way of supporting the management of legal reporting requirements by developing an approach for modeling and analyzing reporting regulations focused on the financial sector. The method is characterized in particular by the ability to represent and analyze legal reporting requirements. Using the examples of Risk Reports and the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the modeling and analysis capabilities of the method will be evaluated.",Business to Government Reporting; Reporting Regulations; Conceptual Modeling,"['test-case generation', ' Java', ' symbolic execution', ' constraint solving', ' simplex algorithm']",en
21961751,Adoption of Municipal e-Government Services – A Communication Problem?,"Although, e-government offers citizens various advantages, the usage rates still lag behind their potentials. Many studies have analysed factors influencing the e-government adoption, however, neglecting the aspect of communication as one crucial antecedent for intention to use. This study tries to close this gap by investigating the role of communication in the acceptance of e-government. We conducted a survey with 103 citizens in a medium-sized municipality. Results reveal that both user and non-users of e-government services would like governments to provide more information especially on the existence of services, the benefits as well as privacy and data security. We found strong support for users having used e-government services once to be very likely to use them again. We encourage governments to adjust their communication strategy to citizens' needs and provide further information on e-government especially via the governments' website.","['Communication', 'Diffusion of innovations', 'E-government adoption', 'Tam']","['test-case generation', ' symbolic execution', ' Java', ' constraint solving', ' simplex algorithm']",en
21972165,Exploring the Dynamics of Culture in the Roll-out and Adoption of eCollaboration Technology: A Case Study Comparison,"Implementing eCollaboration technologies implies specific organizational challenges surrounding roll-out and adoption. IT adoption literature has researched the concept of culture and the notion of fit between IT and culture. However, in the context of eCollaboration technologies, cultural fit as a possible influence factor has not been explored sufficiently. Thus, we aim at closing this gap by exploring the role of culture in the roll-out and adoption of eCollaboration technologies. We present two cases of eCollaboration technology roll-out that contrast in the extent to which the technology was adopted. The cases were analyzed from a culture perspective. Although our results confirmed the relevance of cultural fit, they also revealed additional dimensions of the concepts of culture and cultural fit that should be investigated further. Our paper contributes to a better understanding of the nature of cultural influence in the organizational roll-out and adoption of eCollaboration technologies.",IT roll-out and adoption; eCollaboration technologies; culture,"['Java', ' logic programming', ' integration of programming paradigms', ' constraint solving']",en

Ten knowledge types (comprising of both commercial and engineering) were identified as being essential for CE2. A lateral transfer of these cost-knowledge types is required across the CE2 existing experts, and for the professions' novices. If the knowledge used within the costing domain is successfully transferred across it, the comprehension of the interacting cost experts, and the communication between them will increase: Resulting in the consistent production of faster, more accurate estimates. A training analysis (DIF) was performed per knowledge type, in order to determine which required formal training; and which would suffice with informal. The relevant knowledge was then grouped into training modules for development. The primary focus for this training development is within the aerospace and automotive industries.",,"['functional logic programming', ' functional programming', ' constraint logic programming', ' declarative programming', ' integration of programming paradigms', ' term rewriting']",en

The state of the art analysis was performed within the framework of the E-MODE project, held at Cranfield University. E-MODE project aims to develop a design and manufacturing cost model for the embedded systems used by the automotive industry. It is a novel research area, with not so much work having been done so far. In its very basic decomposition, an embedded system consists of hardware and software that controls this hardware. This paper examines the embedded software cost engineering domain and identifies the lack of historical data, the failing of existing models to capture the special characteristics of embedded software, the incompatibility of the examined commercial models to address embedded software cost estimating requirements without significant validation and calibration, the absence of defined systems requirements in the initial stages and the weakness of models proposed by academia to capture qualitative issues as the five challenges regarding embedded software cost estimating.",,"['Service networks', ' Research agenda', ' BRIC']",en

For accurate and flexible purchasing it is important to be able to effectively combine input data from various types of sources. This paper proposes a method based on fuzzy sets to solve the problem of effective exploitation of expert knowledge and statistics of demand to determine the optimal amount of a purchase order. A membership function is used to model demand for a product. This membership function can be built using statistics, expert knowledge, or both. After membership functions for each product are created, purchasing optimization takes place based on these functions. The proposed approach supports decision making process based on formal methods of fuzzy, uncompleted or permanently changing information. The developed models and algorithms can be used for optimum assortment determination of enterprises involved in production and distribution of various types of goods","['Demand model', 'Fuzzy sets', 'Purchasing']","['Application customization, Mashups, Meta-programming, Social tagging, Web customization']",en

In order to contribute towards a more comprehensive solution a basis for a taxonomy of design mismatches is presented. The paper argues that a multi-Agent approach is a more effective, and a promising, way forward towards a reliable automatic solution to the problem. An outline multi-Agent architecture is proposed. The architecture assumes that the design knowledge is encapsulated within the different members of agent community. Agents are endowed with the capacity of negotiation with one another to ensure that any mismatches are detected and that a solution is proposed. The notions of proactiviness and social ability, which the agents need to exhibit, are central to this work.",,,en
21987677,Social Media and Political Communication - A Social Media Analytics Framework,"In recent years, social media are said to have an impact on the public discourse and communication in the society. In particular, social media are increasingly used in political context. More recently, microblogging services (e.g., Twitter) and social network sites (e.g., Facebook) are believed to have the potential for increasing political participation. While Twitter is an ideal platform for users to spread not only information in general but also political opinions publicly through their networks, political institutions (e.g., politicians, political parties, political foundations, etc.) have also begun to use Facebook pages or groups for the purpose of entering into direct dialogues with citizens and enabling political discussions. Previous studies have shown that from the perspective of political institutions, there is a need to continuously collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize politically relevant information from social media. These activities, which are subsumed under &ldquo;social media analytics,&rdquo; are considered difficult tasks due to a large numbers of different social media platforms and large amount as well as complexity of information and data. Systematic tracking and analysis approaches along with appropriate methods and techniques in political domain are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a framework for social media analytics in political context. More specifically, our framework summarizes different politically relevant analyses from the perspective of political institutions and according scientific methodologies that could be applied to analyze political communication in social media.",social media; social media analytics; framework; political communication,"['Collaborative Business Process Modelling', ' Modelling Tools', ' Tool Analysis', ' Collaborative Architecture']",en
21999733,Towards an integrated framework for phase-specific media choice in virtual creative group processes,"In an increasingly globalized world creative work is often conducted by virtual teams all over the globe. Those virtual teams cannot meet physically to collaborate, cooperate and communicate. Virtual team work saves money, directly by cutting costs of travel and indirectly by saving time, but these effects are thwarted if the results of the group work suffer from group losses and risks inherent in creative work. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to mitigate such potential risks and losses in creative group processes by the right choice of media. The results are then combined with the creative group process in an integrated framework for media choice in specific phases of the creative group process. We believe that considering this framework when choosing media for creative group processes leads to a better process flow and thus better results, i.e. higher product quality. © 2012 IEEE.","['creative group process', 'creative risks', 'creativity', 'media choice', 'virtual teams']","['CSCW, Enterprise 2.0, Enterprise microblogging, Social software']",en

It combines the advantages of object-orientation such as easy maintainability and adaptability due to inheritance and encapsulation of structure and behavior with the advantages of logic languages such as suitability for search problems. Java annotations and a symbolic Java virtual machine are used to handle the logic programming concepts. In contrast to previous approaches to integrate object-oriented and logic programming, we preserve the syntax of Java. Our language is not split into two distinguishable parts but as closely integrated as possible. Besides the design and implementation of Logic Java, providing a suitable interface between conventional and logic computations is the main contribution of this paper. A killer application, which can hardly be implemented more elegantly in any other language, is the tool Muggl which systematically generates glass-box test cases for Java programs.

To benefit from the advantages of both techniques we have integrated them into a single hybrid debugger called JHyde. We use JHyde to debug an erroneous mergesort algorithm and mention important aspects of its implementation. Furthermore, we show that the efficiency of the declarative debugging method can be significantly improved by a new debugging strategy.",declarative debugging; Java,,en

Thus, parallel programming still remains a difficult and error-prone task. In order to shield the user from these low-level details, algorithmic skeletons have been proposed. They encapsulate typical parallel programming patterns and have emerged to be an efficient approach to simplifying the development of parallel applications. In this paper, we present our skeleton library Muesli, which not only simplifies parallel programming. Additionally, it allows to write a single application that may be executed on a variety of parallel machines ranging from simple multi-core processors with shared memory to clusters of multi- and many-core processors with distributed memory as well as multi-GPU systems and GPU clusters.

22022422,How to Design and Deliver Process Context Sensitive Information: Concept and Prototype,"Providing employees with relevant, context-specific information is crucial to achieve productivity and efficiency while executing business processes. Today, tools exist to model various aspects of organizations such as processes, organization structures, services, and their descriptions. However, there still exists a gap between information modeling on a conceptual level and information provision on a runtime level that hinders information dissemination and retrieval while employees execute processes. In daily business life, information workers demand for unstructured content to fulfill well-defined process steps. In this paper, we adapt an existing conceptual approach of process-driven information requirements engineering and present its prototypical implementation based on an industry-developed BPM product. Our solution therefore introduces ""information objects"" and integrates these with process activities to model the users' information requirements at process runtime. In doing so, users are empowered to leverage context information such as documents, reports, or emails, while executing human steps in a process.",Information Delivery; Business Process Management; Process Context Sensitivity,"['Mobile Enterprise', ' Transformationsprozess']",en

22030272,"Identification, Specification, and Development of Web-Oriented Architectures","Web-oriented Architectures (WOAs) provide a way of designing an IT system by using a variety of Web Procedures, i.e., procedures (or services) called over the Web. The idea of (typically atomic) components that are black boxes, have interfaces, and can be assembled into a larger process is fundamental and has existed since the early days of distributed systems. Two particular types of modern distributed systems are Service-oriented Architectures and Resource-oriented Architectures, which are built on specific technology stacks and define their own concepts. A WOA uses the best of both worlds plus specifics like Web APIs to build an interconnected IT system in the easiest way possible. In this article, the authors introduce the concept behind a WOA, the topology of a WOA, and possible integration scenarios within an enterprise. More importantly, the authors discuss what a methodology for building a WOA can look like and how control can be achieved, by using a logical software element called the Web Architecture Controller, which specifies the Web-centric core elements of a WOA. Lastly, the cost of implementing and running such a system is briefly addressed. © 2012, IGI Global.

22030349,Web-Wide Application Customization: The Case of Mashups,"Mashups have become popular in recent years in the context of Web 2.0 developments. They represent a way of allowing an application to grow beyond the capabilities of its original developers through an incorporation of external functionality. This paper first introduces several approaches to integrating mashups into the Web pages or services, which commonly implement ways to determine which mashups are potentially relevant for display in a certain Web page context. It then describes in detail a novel approach called ActiveTags, which enables users to create reliable mashups based on tags and hence customized views of Web pages with tagged content. A scenario that demonstrates the potential benefits of this approach is presented. Moreover, a formalization is presented which suitably combines previous work on modeling the Web with relational meta-programming, thereby showing that ActiveTags (as well as related approaches) can conceptually be described in terms of the relational model of data.

22030591,Business Processes for Business Communities,"After a brief introduction to the topic of business process modeling, the book offers a quick-start into model-based business process engineering. After that, the foundations of the modeling languages used are conveyed. Meaningful examples are in the foreground - each of the underlying formalisms is treated only as far as needed. Next the Horus Method is described in detail. The book defines a sequence of activities which finally leads to the creation of a complete business process model. The Horus Method, incidentally, is not bound to the use of the Horus software tools. It can be used with other tools or, if necessary, be used even without tool support. Important application fields of business process engineering are described, where the spectrum ranges from business process reengineering to the development and implementation of information systems. The book concludes with an outlook on the future of business process engineering and highlights current research activities in the area.",Business Process Modeling; Petri nets; Horus methodology,"['Computer-mediated communication, Interactivity, Social networks']",en

22038309,Collaborative Process Modelling - Tool Analysis and Design Implications,"Business process modelling is an integral component of Business Process  Management and is, by na-ture, a collaborative act that involves many  stakeholders. Process modelling initiatives, while not able dependent on  technology, are often supported by one or more dedicated commercial  software tools. However, while a broad range of process modelling  aspects have been researched, little is known about how to support  modelling with collaborative tools. Accordingly, we aim to elicit a  better under-standing of the nature of collaborative process modelling  and its support in modelling tools. Our study is based on the assumption  that tool designers hold certain conceptions about how people use  model-ling tools and that such conceptions become inscribed in the  tools. By analysing and classifying a sample of modelling tools, with  regards to their collaborative features for supporting the modelling  task, we aim to elicit an understanding of the collaborative aspects of  process modelling. Our study finds only very fragmented collaborative  functionality across our tool selection and builds on these findings to  suggest a high-level architecture for collaborative support in process  modelling tools.",Collaborative Business Process Modelling; Modelling Tools; Tool Analysis; Collaborative Architecture,,en
22038390,What are you doing? – Enterprise Microblogging as Context Building,"With the advent of Twitter, microblogging has turned into a widely discussed phenomenon. Due to its perceived impact, many organisations have begun experimenting with the use of microblogging 'behind the firewall', in order to support internal communication and group work. However, Enterprise Microblogging (EMB) is still in its infancy and not yet well understood. With this study we want to add to the rather limited body of knowledge a case study of Enterprise Microblogging in an academic setting. A multidisciplinary team of University researchers has adopted the platform Communote to collaborate and communicate. We conduct a genre analysis of the team's microblogging stream and find that EMB mainly serves as an effective medium for context building and meeting coordination in a project of otherwise loosely related individual activities. We compare our results with findings from two existing EMB cases, one of which has investigated the use of the same IT artefact in a different context. We find striking differences in usage patterns and show that EMB is highly dependent on the particular organisational context shared by the EMB users. Consequently, we conclude that appropriation of Enterprise Microblogging happens largely in accordance with organisational context characteristics.","['CSCW', 'Enterprise 2.0', 'Enterprise microblogging', 'Social software']",,en
22038465,Short Message Discussions: On the Conversational Nature of Microblogging in a Large Consultancy Organisation,"With the rise of Twitter Microblogging as a phenomenon has gained widespread popularity. As with other social software (e.g. Wikis), organisations have begun experimenting with the application of Microblogging for facilitating internal communication and group processes. However, research on the topic is still in its infancy. In this paper we explore how Yammer, a Twitter-like platform, has been adopted within Capgemini, a large, globally operating consultancy business. In contrast to existing findings on Twitter usage and other Enterprise Microblogging (EMB) cases, we find that EMB in our case is a predominantly conversational medium, where people interact with each other explicitly. Rather than using the platform to inform others about themselves (Twitter) or, about their immediate task/team context as has been described in other EMB cases, the Yammer users in this case are expressing views, discussing opinion and responding to each other. We discuss these results in light of the particular organisational context of the case and the emergent nature of communication technologies. We further demonstrate how the interactive and conversational nature of short message communications has led us to investigate the classification of Microblogging according to the context of its use. We conclude that the appropriation of Enterprise Microblogging is shaped largely by the characteristics of the organisational context in which it is used and propose a model that supports this.","['Enterprise microblogging', 'Platform appropriation', 'Social software', 'Yammer']",,en
22038540,Eliciting the anatomy of technology Appropriation Processes: A Case Study in enterprise social media,"The investigation of IT adoption and diffusion in organisations is a core topic of the IS discipline. However, orthodox theories take a mostly rationalist view that treats adoption as a decision situation. In this paper, we aim to show that it is necessary to appreciate the process nature of taking new technology into organisational contexts, and the open-ended nature of this process in terms of social sense-making about the new technology. At the same time, as more and more organisations let social media be part of work and communication practices, understanding what happens when individuals begin to experiment with and participate in these new mediums is increasingly important. Against this backdrop, we present the findings of an in-depth data analysis of enterprise-based short message communications shared across the Yammer enterprise social network at international service consultancy Capgemini. We focus on appropriation-related communication in the first nine months of uptake. By undertaking a time-trend analysis we identify the essential phases in which sense-making and appropriation take place as Yammer is enrolled into Capgemini practices. Our study makes an important contribution toward understanding the processes of technology appropriation in general and sense-making in social media in particular.",IT adoption and diffusion; Enterprise Social Media; short message communication; social sense-making,,en

22038867,The IT Strategy Divide: Professional Practice and Academic Debate,"Information Technology (IT) strategy is a top-priority issue in practice. However, despite its practical relevance, research on IT strategy has been limited so far. With respect to the definition of an IT strategy and its scope, there are a number of ad hoc recommendations and a few conceptual models with little scientific backing. In particular, latest research indicates a gap between the academic discussion on IT strategy and how IT strategy is perceived in practice. Taking this as a motivation, our research sets out to uncover in more detail the concerns and the notions of IT strategy prevalent in practice. <br /><br />This paper reports on the results of a qualitative research project which included interviews with IT strategy professionals from twelve mid-size to large companies in German speaking countries. It compares the experts' IT strategy practice with the concerns and perceptions that dominate research and the academic discussion. <br /><br />Our study uncovers striking differences between the academic debate on IT strategy and the concerns IT strategy professional look upon as being important. First of all, we found that professionals are concerned with IT strategy on two different levels, the corporate level and the business unit level strategy. Academics, in contrast, look at IT strategy mostly from a business unit and departmental level. Irrespective of the differences in the level of IT strategy, the strategy concerns focused on in academia differ substantially from those that our professionals were most interested in. The focus of the academic discussion is on IT-based competitive advantages and stresses the role of information as strategic resources, while practitioners are most concerned with decisions on IT infrastructure, IT architecture and standards. <br /><br />The paper at hand does not only analyse the differences but also takes a closer look at the reasoning of academics and professionals for looking upon certain IT issues as ""strategic"". Both, the IT strategy concerns raised by our professionals and the rationales used provide valuable input for future research and theory development.",IT strategy; IT strategy concerns; IT strategy content; strategic IT decisions; strategic infor-mation systems planning (SISP); IT strategy practice,,en
22038952,A Literature Overview on Strategic Information Management,"Strategic Information Systems Planning (SISP) has been among the highest ranked issues on management agendas for many years. As such, SISP should be a major concern for re-searchers as well. However, SISP does not play that important of a role in the academic discussion, at least in Germany. Leading German textbooks on Information Management devote only small sections to strategy themes. Moreover, the recommendations given for conducting SISP in these textbooks are mainly normative and hardly take international research findings into account. Taking this as a motivation, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of German and Anglo-American information systems journals. Our objective was to understand more fully what we know about SISP through international research. On the flip side, our research aims at identifying fields that are in urgent need for closer academic investigation so that individual speculations and normative recommendations might still substitute for valid research insights. Overall, we found a considerable amount of research conducted in the field of SISP that we organised in five broad thematic fields: Strategic IT impact, approaches to SISP, information systems strategy, and strategic alignment. We give a short overview of research conducted so far and seminal publications available in the research fields. Moreover, based on a sub-sample of our literature base, we compute statistics which indicate the intensity of the academic discussion in the different thematic fields over time. Our statistics show that most attention has been paid to the competitive use of IT. The IS strategy in contrast has only been of limited interest, though it is central to any strategic considerations in IS. Our survey also suggests that German speaking researchers have devoted relatively few efforts to SISP in comparison to their Anglo-American colleagues.",Strategic Information System (SIS); Strategic Information Systems Planning (SISP); IS Strategy; IT-based competitive advantage; SISP approach; Strategic Alignment,"['social media', ' cio', ' unternehmensintern', ' internal', ' rollen', ' aufgaben']",en
22039475,Virtual or vague? a literature review exposing conceptual differences in defining virtual organizations in IS research,"The concept of &lsquo;virtual organization' was coined about 15years ago to describe changes in organizational structures and value creation, enabled by the affordances of ICT. Not surprisingly, the Information Systems community has been influential in researching virtual organization phenomena. However, it appears that, since the notion of &lsquo;virtual' in its most basic connotation only denotes some form of difference to a &lsquo;traditional' form of organization, the term VO has been interpreted in varied form with an unsatisfying mix of VO notions existing in the literature. What is more, papers frequently exhibit mismatches between what they characterize as VO and the real-life phenomena they discuss. Motivated by these observations we carry out a literature analysis to explore differing notions of virtual organization. Based on a systematic classification of VO definitions, we uncover three distinct types of VO that are used in the literature, each of which interprets the notion of &lsquo;virtual' differently, but is useful in its own right and exhibits unique management challenges. The first type, named Internal VO, revolves around internal virtualization based on distributed collaboration in virtual teams. It emerged on the back of emerging new groupware and communication technologies. Its main challenges stem from distributed project and work organization. The second type, named Network VO, describes a network of smaller companies that form a virtual entity, bringing in core competencies in short term collaborative projects. It emerged on the back of a emerging inter-organizational information systems and a trend of forming network arrangement. Its main challenges are with the governance of the multi-entity network. The third type, termed Outsourcing VO, refers to a hierarchical network of suppliers to which the focal firm outsources a significant part of its value creation, thus appearing as a virtual firm. It emerged on the back of the outsourcing trend of the last decades. Its main challenge is determining the optimal degree of integration and virtualization. With the identification and detailed exploration of the three VO types, our study contributes to a better understanding of the conceptual foundation of VO research and points to the necessity for conceptual clarity in future research.",virtual organization; business network; virtual value chain; literature review,"['Political communication, Retweetability, Sentiment, Twitter']",en

22039631,Increasing team coordination and social motivation through awareness practices: A case study,"People working in teams are vulnerable to so-called process losses, which occur when the teams output is less than what could be produced given the capabilities of the team members. Teams can develop practices that provide awareness of each other's activities, thereby enabling them to coordinate activities better and reducing one of these process losses coordination loss. Such awareness is harder to maintain when team members are geographically dispersed, but can be promoted using social computing technologies. We present a framework derived from a case study that identifies drivers of awareness practices in geographically dispersed teams. Our investigation indicates that new awareness practices were developed at times when the teams faced changes in the team's goals, social computing context, physical context, and team structure. The teams developed awareness practices to improve coordination in the teams, but the practices had the added effect of decreasing social motivation losses. Based on these results, organizations that are considering implementing social computing technologies such as life streaming and microblogging are advised to take social motivation into account formulating their implementation strategies. Designers and users of social computing technology are similarly advised to consider latent social motivation effects that might occur in organizational teams when social computing technology and practices are introduced.",awareness; coordination; social loafing,"['E-learning, Entrepreneurship, Experiential Learning, Second Life, Virtual Worlds']",en

22059409,The Role of Linguistic Properties in Online Dating Communication - A Large-scale Study of Contact Initiation Messages,"For people who look for a partner, online dating largely increases the pool of potential mates. At the same time, users of online dating platforms have to cope with a large number of approaches and, therefore, need to choose selectively who they decide to engage in a conversation with. Especially, since the costs of rejection are low on online dating platforms, it is a common strategy to spam others with superficial approaches. With this in mind, and in the absence of nonverbal cues, targets base their decision of whether or not to respond to a message on (a) their impression of the sender's pictures, and (b) cues which they extract from the content of the message. The purpose of this study is to hypothesize on which linguistic properties of a message in computer-mediated communication may signal various qualities of its sender, to predict how those properties determine a target's decision of whether to respond or to ignore an initial message. Employing the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis, relevant variables are operationalized from a corpus of 167,276 initial messages of an online dating platform. Regression analysis is performed in order to test the hypotheses. Results are discussed with respect to design implications for online dating platforms.","['Computer-mediated communication', 'Online dating', 'Text analysis']","['Brand Communication', ' Social Media', ' Adidas', ' Twitter']",en

The purpose of this work is to assess concerns regarding the quality of the relationships supported through online social networks. Properties of interaction are assumed to be a reasonable benchmark for the quality of relationships among people. Therefore, we analyze interactions on Facebook to examine how affective dimensions of messages determine the quantity and kind of interaction they experience. We find that (1) that posting sad messages encourages peers to respond verbally, while (2) articulating positive emotions reduces verbal responses, but leads to more feedback in terms of received likes. Text analysis shows that the sentiment of verbal responses is significantly determined by the sentiment of the message: (3) positive emotions trigger positive feedback, and (4) negative emotions trigger negative responses.

As people use different networks for different purposes, communication is a common goal. Activities in virtual social networks result in a massive amount of information. User-generated content is clustered respect to platform, way of communication as well as quality and richness of content. Often the subject of information exchange deals with personal issues concerning events and individuals. Until now this information is not considered by means of classic information retrieval. Identifying distinct subjects, gathering and analyzing information and putting them into relationship at once are open scientific challenges.

22060916,Challenges of MANET for Mobile Social Networks,"In the last years mobile networking via smart phones and mobile telephones is widely realized as an infrastructure based networking. The provider grants an affordable and stable access to the Internet, which can be used by applications in the same way as it is used on stationary computers. However, many mobile devices support a variety of communication interfaces that are suitable for ad-hoc communication. For example, WIFI and Bluetooth can be used for ad-hoc networking. One reason, why these networking devices are rarely used in ad-hoc mode by mobile applications, is that limitations in the reliability of network access have to be considered as long as they have to provide more than 1-to-1 communication. This contribution points out, that despite all technical issues the consideration of social aspects and commercial aspects is a major point for any success off MANET technology for mobile applications. We discuss a message centric approach to ad-hoc networking, which relies on simple store and forward mechanism to spread data asynchronously in the network. This technique can be used for specific applications only, which depends on tailored value-chain setups to be spread in the market. We also point out the application specific constraints that go along in with the abduction of infrastructure-based networking. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","['Mobile ad-hoc network', 'Mobile networking value-chain', 'Time shifted message propagation']",,en

In this study, we seek to gain insight into the political communication based on social media in Germany by conducting an analysis of social media presence of German political parties on Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube as well as a survey of members of the German parliament regarding their social media use. Based on the results, we present an overview of the relevance and potentials of as well as obstacles to the usage of social media for political communication from the perspective of political institutions. Further, we derive implications regarding the need for social media monitoring in political context as well as research implications in information systems.","['E-participation', 'Political Communication', 'Social Media']",,en
22063196,Impact and Diffusion of Sentiment in Political Communication - An Empirical Analysis of Political Weblogs,"In this paper, we examine whether sentiment of political blog entries is associated with increased feedback in terms of the quantity of triggered comments and whether the diffusion of sentiment might take place in the political blogosphere. Based on a data set of approximately 17,000 blog entries from the 60 most important German political blogs, we find that blog entries with either more positive or more negative overall sentiment tend to receive significantly more comments compared to sentiment-neutral or mixed-sentiment entries. Furthermore, our results show that positive as well as negative emotions might diffuse in the subsequent comments to corresponding blog entries.",Social media; Blogs; Sentiment,"['Reference architecture', ' Complex event processing', ' Business process management', ' Business process analytics', ' Business activity management']",en
22063274,Challenges for Lecturers in Virtual Worlds,"Current research shows that three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds can be effectively used in distance learning. Their immersive environment as well as the extensive repertoire of communication and collaboration means such as voice over IP, 3D representations, and instant text messaging are central characteristics of virtual worlds. These features, characteristics, and their playful character make virtual worlds interesting for imparting and sharing knowledge in distance learning settings. Research results reveal that, in general, teaching in distance learning requires a flexible usage of various didactical concepts and moderation strategies which makes this mode of teaching more complex and challenging for teachers than imparting knowledge in face-to-face settings or via traditional e-learning platforms.  This paper aims at analyzing and understanding teachers&rsquo; roles and functions in distance learning, which base on the virtual world Second Life, by conduction comparative case study analyses with existing didactical concepts.  As teachers&rsquo; and students&rsquo; representation as avatars result in a high degree of social presence in virtual worlds experiential learning can be facilitated. However, for imparting experiential knowledge in virtual worlds teachers are confronted by various teaching situations. Teachers&rsquo; main task is motivating and moderating discussions among students rather than presenting content. As our study shows that this kind of &ldquo;e-moderation&rdquo; is complex and demanding. Didactical and technical skills are required to apply different teaching methods.",Virtual Worlds; Second Life; Gaming; E-Moderation,"['architecture, business activity monitoring, business process management, complex event processing, service networks']",en
22063352,Impact and Diffusion of Sentiment in Political Communication - An Empirical Analysis of Public Political Facebook Pages,"In recent years, political parties and politicians have begun to use public Facebook &ldquo;pages&rdquo; not only for the purpose of self-presentation but also to aim at entering into direct dialogues with citizens and enabling political discussions. Not only the owner of the page but also any people who are politically interested can create politically relevant postings on the &ldquo;Wall&rdquo; of the page. These &ldquo;Wall posts&rdquo; often exhibit sentiment associated with certain political topics, political parties or politicians. In this paper, we seek to examine whether sentiment occurring in Wall posts on public political Facebook pages has an effect on feedback in terms of the quantity of triggered comments. Based on a data set of 5,626 Wall posts from Facebook pages of German political parties and politicians, we find different significant relationships between the quantity of words indicating positive and negative emotions in a Wall post and the number of its corresponding comments. Furthermore, our results show that positive as well as negative emotions might diffuse in the subsequent comments.",social media; Facebook; sentiment; political discussion,,en
22064223,Brand Communication in Twitter - a Case Study on Adidas,"In recent years, communication in public social media increasingly affected enterprises. Internet users began to share information about products, brands, and companies. Research currently focuses on investigating this form of communication by using quantitative methods in order to get a better understanding of it and of its relevance for companies and society. However, little is known about how enterprises themselves spread information in social media and how stakeholders talk about brands and products. In our work, we investigate communication genres directed from stakeholder- to-stakeholder, from business-to-stakeholder, and from stakeholder-to-business. By doing this, we were able to broadly analyze the content of communication in social media. In our research, we focus on the company adidas, an international manufacturer of sports clothes. We concentrate on the awareness aspect and adapted a theoretical model in order to evaluate company- related communication in Twitter. Our case study includes 289,513 tweets which were collected on 60 consecutive days. In order to identify genres and to answer the research questions, we manually analyzed 500 randomly chosen tweets as well as all those tweets published by official corporate accounts. We come to the conclusion that communication in social media is indeed of high importance for adidas. Furthermore, we show that adidas enters the communication in Twitter strategically to increase the awareness of their products.",Brand Communication; Social Media; Adidas; Twitter,,en

22068395,On the Relationship between the IT Artifact and Design Theory: The Case of Virtual Social Facilitation,"Both the IT artifact and design theory are fundamental elements of a design science project. While literature provides an extensive discussion on why IT artifacts and design theory can be regarded as two sides of the same coin, an operational detailed model on how to actually decode and translate the one into the other is not yet to be found. In this paper, we address this important issue taking the example of social facilitation, a theory perspective that informs us about how the integration of social media features in IT-based routine work can increase task performance. With the help of this example we are able to demonstrate how a lack of discussion regarding the relationship between the actual implementation (IT artifact perspective) and corresponding variables (design theory perspective) can create significant issues of scientific rigor. In order to overcome this gap, we develop a design theorizing framework that differentiates between the structural model (inner model), the measurement model, and the design model (both outer model components). Based on our findings, the paper concludes with discussing potentially fruitful avenues for future research and theory development in design science.",Design theory; Framework; Artifact-Theory Relationship; Instantiation; Virtual Social Facilitation,"['Twitter', ' Sentiment', ' Retweetability', ' Political Communication']",en
22083353,Mobile Platforms as Two-sided Markets,"Mobile platforms combine state-of-the-art mobile phones, i.e., smartphones, with innovative operating systems and so-called app stores. App stores are a special kind of search and product market. They allow consumers to search, buy and install apps for their smartphone. These apps are built for a specific operating system and provide additional functionality. App developers use the app store to promote and sell their products. Adoption by consumers and developers depends on the platform as a whole. We introduce the notion of two-sided markets to mobile platforms. Apple's iPhone and App Store as well as Google's Android phones and market are described as a practical example. Theories of two-sided markets are reviewed and analyzed for their applicability to the mobile platform scenario. We identify and discuss promising aspects, pitfalls and shortcomings of existing models. Open research questions are revealed. We find that Rochet and Tirole's model of two-sided markets provides a good match. It explains some of the peculiarities observed. However, as other models, it falls short of comprehensively representing the mobile scenario. Hence, we identify what a comprehensive model needs to provide and outline extensions to existing models. Furthermore, we apply the work of Parker and Van Alstyne to motivate the strategic decisions observed in the mobile market. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","['Mobile Markets', 'Mobile Platforms', 'Smartphones', 'Two-sided Markets']","['Practice Theory', ' Structuration Theory', ' IS Evolution', ' Inter-organisational Information Systems', ' Change', ' Causality', ' Communities of Practice', ' Boundary Objects']",en
22083432,A Framework for Creating Domain-specific Process Modeling Languages,"Using domain-specific modeling languages to capture business processes can greatly enhance quality and efficiency of process modeling, because language and models are more expressive, concise and easy to understand. The development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) with accompanying tools and transformations is, however, a complex, time-consuming, and costly task. An efficient and simple approach to creating process modeling languages (PMLs) for specific business domains by reusing common parts is needed, where each resulting language is still optimally adjusted to its domain. For each of these languages, the abstract and concrete syntax have to be defined as well as transformations to more general languages. This paper presents DSLs4BPM, a generic framework for PMLs, which employs DSL modularization concepts to allow the derivation of domain-specific PMLs. The framework provides elements common to process modeling and a basic transformation to the generic Business Process Model and Notation 2.0. DSLs are created by adding own types to the framework language and own rules to the transformation at predefined extension points. The approach has been implemented based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework.","['BPMN 2', 'Business process modeling', 'Domain-specific languages', 'EMF', 'Model transformation']","['algorithmic skeletons', ' parallel programming', ' multi-core architectures', ' OPenMP']",en

At least five operating systems are considered important. Developing mobile applications (apps) is thus challenging. Since native development for several platforms requires extreme effort, we designed criteria to assess cross-platform development approaches. We applied our criteria to Web apps, to apps developed with PhoneGap and Titanium Mobile, and - for comparison - to natively developed apps. Particularly the two frameworks are interesting from a Web developer's perspective since they bridge the gap between Web development and mobile information systems. Our findings are presented as reference tables. Furthermore, we generalize our results. Our criteria have proven to be viable for follow-up evaluations. With regard to the approaches, we specifically found PhoneGap viable if very close resemblance of a native look & feel can be neglected.","['App', 'Cross-platform', 'Mobile application', 'Multi-platform']","['Multi channel management, Strategic alignment, Strategy process']",en

22097210,E-assessment and software testing,"To overcome the high manual effort of assessments for teaching personnel, e-assessment systems are used to assess students using information systems (IS). The purpose of this paper is to propose an extension of EASy, a system for e-assessment of exercises that require higher-order cognitive skills. The latest module allows assessing programming exercises in conjunction with particular test-driven-development and back-to-back testing. EASy was developed following a design science research approach. To prove the effectiveness of the approach, the authors discuss findings from a survey that was conducted with almost 200 students from a programming lecture and present quantitative and qualitative findings. Most students reflected positively on using EASy. EASy proves to be a versatile tool and the extension meets the authors' aims. Several details require further investigation, most notably usability and the support of tutors. E-assessment is a field that requires much future research to enable commercial-scale systems for assessment of higher-order cognitive skills. The authors' research is currently limited in the number of exercise types the system supports. EASy is a research tool despite being used in actual lectures. It is not yet a general e-assessment solution. While EASy is a research prototype, its usage in lectures demonstrates the practicability of using e-assessment. EASy currently is one of the few systems with advanced capabilities. The paper strongly contributes to the knowledge base on building e-assessment systems; thus, it is relevant both for practitioners seeking to establish e-assessment and to researchers trying to understand the future needs towards comparable systems. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","['Assessment', 'Computer software', 'E-assessment', 'E-learning', 'Examinations', 'Germany', 'Online learning', 'Software test', 'Software testing']",,en

Online booking platforms such as booking.com or hotel.de bring together hotels and their customers. Hotels and booking customers are the main customer groups of the platform. This paper explores the business model of a large online hotel booking platform, hotel.de, using a case study approach. By serving two customer groups simultaneously, hotel.de has to deal with the specific dynamics that unfold on the two sides of its platform and align its business model accordingly. The results reveal that hotel.de maintains two distinct business models for the two customer groups, offering a unique set of value propositions to each of them. A third, overarching business model links the two sides by simultaneously solving both sides' specific problems and creating a match between booking customers and hotels. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","['Business model', 'Cybermediation', 'Multi-sided market', 'Platform', 'Tourism market']",,en

22169923,Extending BPMN for Business Activity Monitoring,"Real-time access to key performance indicators is necessary to ensure timeliness and effectiveness of operational business processes. The concept of Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) refers to the observation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about business activities across systems' and companies' borders. Designing and maintaining BAM applications is challenging, as the involved concepts (e.g., business processes, audit logs, performance measures) --though being strongly interrelated-- are developed by different communities of practice. Also, they reside on different levels of abstraction, and are handled by different IT systems. Hence, we developed a conceptual modeling language which extends the widely accepted Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) by BAM-relevant concepts. The main results presented in this paper are: (1) a meta-model which formally describes the conceptual aspects of the developed BPMN extension (abstract syntax); (2) graphical symbols as an exemplary representation of this abstract syntax (concrete syntax); (3) a demo scenario that illustrates the application of the language in a fictitious scenario.",,,en

22183747,Political Communication and Influence through Microblogging - An Empirical Analysis of Sentiment in Twitter Messages and Retweet Behavior,"Microblogging services such as Twitter are said to have the potential for increasing political participation. Given the feature of ""retweeting"" as a simple yet powerful mechanism for information diffusion, Twitter is an ideal platform for users to spread not only information in general but also political opinions through their networks as Twitter may also be used to publicly agree with, as well as to reinforce, someone's political opinions or thoughts. Besides their content and intended use, Twitter messages (""tweets"") also often convey pertinent information about their author's sentiment. In this paper, we seek to examine whether sentiment occurring in politically relevant tweets has an effect on their retweetability (i.e., how often these tweets will be retweeted). Based on a data set of 64,431 political tweets, we find a positive relationship between the quantity of words indicating affective dimensions, including positive and negative emotions associated with certain political parties or politicians, in a tweet and its retweet rate. Furthermore, we investigate how political discussions take place in the Twitter network during periods of political elections with a focus on the most active and most influential users.

22234108,Evolution of Inter-organizational Information Systems on Long Timescales: A Practice Theory Approach,"Inter-organizational Information Systems (IOIS) are computer-based systems shared by, or connecting, several organizations. The on-going use and evolution on long timescales of these large-scale socio-technical systems so far cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of existing theories of IS adoption, implementation, and use. In this chapter, we present a theory of IOIS in which the on-going use and evolution of IOIS is treated as a practical and socio-material accomplishment of communities through boundary practices and structures. We draw on the structure/action reproduction paradigm of Structuration Theory to account for the persistence of these systems, and thus explain their structure, while using the embodiment of action from Practice Theory to treat the material nature of these systems. We distinguish three dimensions of structure - material, normative, and ideational - and we also distinguish patterns of actions (along these three dimensions) from constraining and enabling structures. However, we attempt to treat these three structural dimensions and their reproduction processes symmetrically throughout. This symmetrical treatment leads us to propose that these action/structure dimensions are not reproduced in isolation but rather undergo an intimate mixing, or mangling, in the process, which in turn suggests a new kind of two-way causal accommodation between the various aspects of structure that we term ""resonance.""",Practice Theory; Structuration Theory; IS Evolution; Inter-organisational Information Systems; Change; Causality; Communities of Practice; Boundary Objects,,en

Exemplary findings from the case are presented. This study concentrates on the development and shaping of a strategy process and supporting instruments which facilitate channel alignment but also reflects on strategic channel alignment as socially accomplished and situated activity. The instruments can be used to gather rich information in a structured way and to gain the required level of understanding necessary to facilitate communication and collaboration between managers to ultimately achieve alignment.,"['Multi channel management', 'Strategic alignment', 'Strategy process']",,

Ad intrusiveness, as conceptualized by Li et al., is introduced to the field of mobile advertising and used as dependent variable in a 2x2 within-subjects factorial study design. Two message types (informative vs. entertaining) are combined with two different situations (low vs. high level of activity). Attitude towards advertising in general and ad relevance (here: product class involvement) are further variables assessed in order to test for a hypothesized impact on mobile ad intrusiveness. A survey approach was used for data collection (n=325). Main effects were analyzed with analysis of variance. Analysis of covariance and regression analysis were applied subsequently for analyzing further effects. While message type was not found to contribute significantly to the explanation of mobile ad intrusiveness, the situation type showed a highly significant effect. Three of the four assumed relationships were found in the data. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on mobile advertising effectiveness. Empirical evidence for the effects of the situational context on mobile advertising effectiveness has been found and discussed with possible implications for marketing practice.","['Intrusiveness', 'Message type', 'Mobile advertising', 'Situation']",,

Motivated by such recurring statements, this paper introduces user-device attachment as a concept describing the relationship between users and their mobile devices. By drawing on literature from marketing, HCI, and sociology, the domain and dimensions of user-device attachment are described. Three dimensions: symbolism, aesthetics, and perceived necessity are conceptualized to represent elements of user-device attachment. An initial instrument for measurement is developed and assessed with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Corresponding with the conceptualized dimensions, a three-factor solution was found and confirmed using data gathered in two surveys (n1=130, n2=323). The resulting instrument provides a basis for future discussions and conceptual and empirical work on the phenomenon of user-device attachment in mobile user behavior. Possible benefits of applying the construct to areas like mobile advertising and mobile service development are identified. © 2007 IEEE.",,,
22249918,Reconstructing the Giant: On the Importance of Rigour in Documenting the Literature Search Process,"Science is a cumulative endeavour as new knowledge is often created in the process of interpreting and combining existing knowledge. This is why literature reviews have long played a decisive role in scholarship. The quality of literature reviews is particularly determined by the literature search process. As Sir Isaac Newton eminently put it: ""If I can see further, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants."" Drawing on this metaphor, the goal of writing a literature review is to reconstruct the giant of accumulated knowledge in a specific domain. And in doing so, a literature search represents the fundamental first step that makes up the giant's skeleton and largely determines its reconstruction in the subsequent literature analysis. In this paper, we argue that the process of searching the literature must be comprehensibly described. Only then can readers assess the exhaustiveness of the review and other scholars in the field can more confidently (re)use the results in their own research. We set out to explore the methodological rigour of literature review articles published in ten major information systems (IS) journals and show that many of these reviews do not thoroughly document the process of literature search. The results drawn from our analysis lead us to call for more rigour in documenting the literature search process and to present guidelines for crafting a literature review and search in the IS domain.","['IS community', 'IS journals', 'Literature review', 'Literature search', 'Research methodology', 'Rigour']","['construction industry, Diffusion of EDI, institutional design, interorganizational integration, interorganizational systems, network externalities, standardization']",

22250972,The Market for E-Collaboration Systems - Identification of Systems Classes using Cluster Analysis,"E-Collaboration systems, that is software for supporting communication, coordination and cooperation processes in groups, have become the backbone infrastructure to support E-Work in a globalised world where virtual work in and across organisations has become a prevalent modus operandi. Fuelled by recent technology trends numerous new E-Collaboration systems appeared in the marketplace. Today, the market offers an abundance of systems that often support a wide range of features. In this paper a study is presented that aims to shed light on the market for E-Collaboration systems by structuring the range of available systems into meaningful classes. To this end, a sample of 94 E-Collaboration systems is characterised using a classification approach. Application of a cluster analysis led to the identification of five system classes and a range of sub classes. The resulting system classes are described and trends of integration and convergence, which characterise the market, are discussed. The results, being a reflection of the existing market complexity, should be equally helpful for researchers who deal with E-Collaboration systems as their objects of interest, as well as for business executives, who need a market overview to support buying decisions.","['Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'E-Collaboration', 'Groupware', 'Market Study']",,

When introducing such systems, standardization is inevitable and necessary in order to gain benefits from cross-company integration. However, this standardization potentially conflicts with strategic objectives of involved companies. Since the assessment of a system’s costs and benefits varies considerably between potential users, the challenge is not only to balance different incentive levels, but also to create institutional structures which facilitate the successful management of the transformation processes and systems operations. Our contribution focuses on a segment of the Swiss construction industry (mechanical and electrical services), in which a community of interest (Interessengemeinschaft Datenverbund für die Haustechnik-IGH) developed a solution for industry-wide data exchange between producers, wholesalers and crafts enterprises. Despite a lower than initially expected adoption rate, industry reactions and adoption activities by a range of companies suggest a successful implementation.1","['construction industry', 'Diffusion of EDI', 'institutional design', 'interorganizational integration', 'interorganizational systems', 'network externalities', 'standardization']",,

22251813,Towards a Comprehensive Model of Information Strategy,"Strategic information planning is an important topic in practice as well as in research. Work so far has focused mainly on the planning process itself rather than on the actual information strategy as its output. The paper points out different approaches to substantiating the concept of information strategy with perhaps the most advanced approach being the system of plans approach. However, existing approaches are not satisfactory regarding their structure, completeness and rationales. We propose a more comprehensive model of information strategy that is argued to overcome the deficiencies of the existing approaches. Our model introduces the concepts of information infrastructure and information function. It helps to clarify ongoing discussions devoted to information strategy as a functional departmental strategy, to strategic alignment as well as to the role of the CIO and allows the integration of separate views on information strategy from different disciplines.","['Information Resource (IR) Strategy', 'Information Strategy', 'Information Systems (IS) Strategy', 'Information Technology (IT) Strategy', 'Strategic Alignment', 'Strategic Information Planning (SIP)', 'Strategic Information Systems Planning (SISP)']",,

22251965,Information Strategy - Research and Reality,"Strategic information planning and its output, the information strategy, are relevant topics in practice as well as in research. However, current research provides neither a clear nor a consistent picture regarding the concept of information strategy. While unsatisfactory in itself, research in such a state probably also fails to provide practitioners with guidance in developing information strategies. Since practitioners nevertheless widely discuss about information strategy e.g. in practitioner magazines and conferences, the question arises how practitioners understand information strategy. In exploratory interviews, we confirmed a disconnection between research and practice and identified five types of information strategy concepts: Information strategy is understood as a binding guideline, a departmental plan, a change agenda, the market strategy of the IT department or as a set of business unit overarching IT issues. The value of analysing these concepts in practice lies in revealing reasons for the disconnection between research and reality as well as potentially providing a fresh impetus for information strategy research in order to eventually improve the discontenting state of research.","['Information strategy', 'Information systems (IS) strategy', 'Information technology (it) strategy', 'Strategic information planning (SIP)', 'Strategic information systems planning (SISP)']",,

Potential providers of location-based services in mobile commerce have to deal with a high uncertainty regarding consumers’ acceptance and intensity of use. This paper analyses the applicability of conjoint analysis, a classical technique to identify consumer preferences in multiattribute decision making, to the design of new context sensitive services. The method is evaluated by using a fictitious example of location-based services in a touristic setting. It is concluded that despite methodological and contextual limitations conjoint analysis provides valuable insights into consumers’ preferences regarding selected attributes of the specified service. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","['conjoint analysis', 'customer integration', 'location-based services', 'mobile applications', 'mobile services', 'preference measurement', 'service development']",,

22254454,Information Strategy: Confronting Research with Practice,"Strategic information planning is a top-priority issue in practice, as is obvious from the attention it receives at practitioner conferences and in practitioner publications. As a result, some research efforts have been devoted to related topics. So far, the focus has been on strategic information planning processes as well as on information systems/information technology (IS/IT) and competitive advantage, while its result, the strategic information plan or information strategy has been neglected. Consequently, basic questions regarding the content of information strategy have not been investigated or have only been answered in a normative way until now, leaving the domain of information strategy in obscurity and subject to arbitrariness. In this chapter, we present diverse interpretations of information strategy that can be derived from academic discussion. These range from information strategy as a departmental plan, to information strategy as an application portfolio, to information strategy as enumerated lists, to information strategy as a system of plans. We then discuss the results of fourteen qualitative interviews that we conducted with information strategy professionals in practice. In our interviews, we identify twelve decision areas of practical information strategies and six major rationales behind them. We find that organizational constraints, especially the distinction between corporate-and business-level cases, are major contingencies of the observed differences. Our corporate-level cases homogeneously address issues such as (worldwide) standardization of architectures or applications, and the setting of rights and accountability guidelines that coordinate IS/IT activities across the enterprise. In contrast, business-level cases are widely heterogeneous and idiosyncratic in their information strategic contents. Business information strategies were also much broader in content, including decisions on the application landscape, plans for organizing information functions, and decisions on IS/IT investments. We compare the decision areas identified in our research with those discussed in the academic literature. The academic discussion revolves around topics such as IT and competitive advantage, the IT/IS portfolio and investment decisions. In contrast, practitioners strongly emphasize decisions such as standards, which are almost ignored in the academic discussion on information strategy. This suggests the conclusion that there is a gap between academia and practice with respect to information strategy. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that practitioners almost ignore academic literature, while, on the other hand, practical concerns play no role in the academic discourse. Practitioners regard academic literature as too abstract, time consuming, and irrelevant to their practical needs. Academia will have to focus more on practical needs in order to be better accepted and perceived.","['Information strategy', 'Information strategy content', 'Information strategy research', 'Strategic decision areas', 'Strategic information planning (SIP)', 'Strategy contingencies', 'Strategy rationales']",,en
22254548,The IT21 Checkup for IT Fitness: Experiences and Empirical Evidence from 4 Years of Evaluation Practice,"This paper reports on the development and application of an instrument to evaluate the overall IT fitness of medium sized enterprises. The instrument was designed in 1997 as part of an applied research project with the close co-operation of scientists and consultants, as well as various market and technology experts. The resulting toolset has by now been applied to approximately one thousand enterprises mainly in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. This paper discusses the underlying framework for the measurement of IT fitness and describes the basic decisions involved in instrument design. A basic problem for developing such an evaluation instrument is the so called &ldquo;IT productivity paradox&rdquo;: Empirical studies do not yield direct positive relationships between the intensity of IT-usage and business productivity. The paper introduces explanations for the productivity paradox and discusses assumptions on the productive use of IT. This discussion serves as a basis for the formulation of a number of hypotheses on IT-fitness that have entered the framework underlying the IT21 Toolset. The fundamental hypotheses of the framework are finally reassessed statistically based on the data collected with the instrument during the years from 1998 to 2002.",,,de

22254725,Information Strategy - Towards a Comprehensive Model of Information Strategy,"Strategic information planning is an important topic in practice as well as in research. So far, work has mainly focused on the process of Strategic Information Planning (SIP) rather than on its result - the information strategy. But as long as the output of the planning process has not been well defined, all discussions on the process itself necessarily remain vague, too. Hence, research has been challenged with elaborating the concept of information strategy more precisely and in more detail. This paper discusses a comprehensive and comprehensible model of information strategy. The paper starts by analysing different views on information strategy from academic literature, the most advanced of which is perhaps the conceptualisation of information strategy as a system of plans. However, most interpretations found in the literature are implicit while the few explicit conceptualisations are not satisfactorily argued in terms of completeness, structure and rationale. The model proposed in this paper takes into account the interpretations of information strategy prevailing in the academic literature. It is based on a closer investigation of the domain of information strategies and distinguishes different subject matter of information processing. Our model helps to clarify and integrate the ongoing discussions devoted to information strategy as a functional and enterprise-wide strategy, as well as to strategic alignment and to the role of the CIO. It allows for an integration of traditionally separated interpretations on information strategy.","['Information resource (IR) strategy', 'Information strategy', 'Information systems (IS) strategy', 'Information technology (IT) strategy', 'Strategic alignment', 'Strategic information planning (SIP)', 'Strategic information systems planning (SISP)']",,

Much has been written about the structural characteristics and propositions of virtual organisations, but their inherent limitations remain largely unaddressed. Hence, there is a significant gap between the propositions in the literature and the number of successful VO examples in practice. We argue for a more realistic view of the VO, its goals, structural propositions, limitations and challenges. VO are flexible and volatile organisational arrangements with only little formal structures and management mechanisms. While this is a promising proposition on an organisational level, it challenges cooperation on the project and team level. Especially complex and innovative tasks need effective social structures to enable interpersonal cooperation in knowledge-intensive tasks. Based on a conceptual analysis of its structure and by applying social capital theory we are able to identify inherent contradictions and challenges of the VO, which result from a mismatch between task requirements on the project level and its characteristics on the organisational level. Organisational virtualisation in terms of inter-firm cooperation and technological virtualisation in terms of intensive usage of ICT challenge the emergence of social capital as a prerequisite for effective team-level collaboration. At the same time social capital can be seen as a solution to the problems of the VO, given that management finds ways to promote its emergence in the VO. We present some ideas of how to facilitate the emergence of social capital in the VO.","['Social Capital', 'Task complexity', 'Team collaboration', 'Virtual Organisation']",,

22258054,Strategic Information Planning - Insights from an Action Research Project in the Financial Services Industry,"The core purpose of strategic information planning (SIP) lies in identifying future directions for investments in information technology, information systems and information supply that will assist an organisation to realise its business goals. SIP is a critical challenge and major concern to both academics and practitioners, in particular consultants. While the latter have proposed a number of formal methodologies and principles of good practice, these are normative recommendations that are hardly justified through theoretical insight. In fact, SIP is yet to be well understood theoretically and requires more empirical support. This motivated us to carry out an in depth case study on SIP in a financial service company. The study aimed at improving the SIP practices in place and was conducted in an action research-like manner. This research report at hand presents the results of the study. We firstly describe the enterprise, its situation and the SIP practices in place. We then reflect upon the SIP process, its contingencies and its outcome in light of the current academic literature. This leads us to a number of theoretically informed suggestions that concern the improvement of SIP as well as the direction of the resulting information strategy. These suggestions have already been debated with senior IT executives from the case enterprise. This debate helped to confirm some theoretical propositions from literature while other recommendations were not agreed upon by the practitioners. Our findings from the study are finally framed to give a fresh impetus to future research and perhaps challenge some current wisdom.",,,en

22259619,Managing the Process of Channel Alignment - Model-driven strategy development in a multinational corporation,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework and a reference process for achieving channel alignment in companies that use traditional and electronic marketing channels. Instruments for gathering and structuring of information on channel deployment are proposed and integrated in the process of strategy formulation. Design/methodology/approach - The research grounds on a conceptual model of strategic channel alignment (MSCA) that is a recently proposed modification of the well-established strategic alignment model (SAM). Framework, instruments, and reference process were developed by drawing on results from literature analysis and experiences gathered in a research and consulting project at a large multinational corporation. The case context is explicated. Findings - The developed management tools were successfully applied in strategic business units of the case company. They were found to be useful for facilitating strategic channel alignment by fostering processes of communication and collaboration between managers across organizational units. The framework helps to implement a common ""strategy language"" on multi channel management. The instruments support the creation of a shared information base on a company's multi channel strategy and operations. Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to research on strategic alignment processes and discusses model-driven alignment as social process that aims at the construction of a common understanding of multi channel issues. The beneficial role of management tools in such processes is spelled out. Practical implications - The generic nature of the proposed management tools makes further practical applications possible. Companies that strategically address the alignment of their marketing channels can utilize the methodology and adapt it to their specific needs. Originality/value - The paper translates a conceptual management model into a practical methodology. Models like the SAM and the MSCA are frequently discussed but research and reports on their practical value has been scarce. This paper contributes to filling this gap and develops tools of practical value in a particular domain of strategic management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","['Strategic alignment', 'Strategic management', 'Supply chain management']",,
22259695,User-device attachment - Scale development and initial test,"Many authors describe mobile devices as very personal objects and users are said to develop deep relationships with them. Motivated by such recurring statements, this paper introduces user-device attachment as a concept describing the relationship between users and their mobile devices. By drawing on literature from marketing, Human - Computer Interaction, and sociology, the domain and dimensions of user-device attachment are described. Three dimensions: symbolism, aesthetics, and perceived necessity are conceptualised to represent elements of user-device attachment. An initial instrument for measurement is developed and assessed with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Corresponding with the conceptualised dimensions, a threefactor solution was found and confirmed using data gathered in two surveys (n1 = 130, n2 = 323). The resulting instrument provides a basis for future discussions and conceptual and empirical work on the phenomenon of userdevice attachment in mobile user behaviour. Possible benefits of applying the construct to areas like mobile advertising and mobile service development are identified.

22260008,Strategic information systems planning: A case study from the financial services industry,"Strategic Information Systems Planning (SISP) is an important topic for managers and researchers alike. However, there is evidence of a gap between SISP research and practice. Taking this situation as a motivation, we conducted an in depth case study on SISP to investigate this gap. The study was carried out in a German financial services company (FSC) over a period of five months in summer 2003. During this time, the enterprise situation and the information system (IS) practices situation of FSC were studied with respect to the SISP approach in place. Our findings confirm the hypothesis that practitioners largely ignore academic literature and do not use it in support of their SISP endeavours. This is all the more striking since FSC extensively used guidance from IS research in other fields such as systems analysis and software development. Our case study examines in detail two possible explanations for the gap: firstly a lacking transfer of academic knowledge to practice, and secondly deficiencies in the academic knowledge base itself. In fact, our observations highlight a disconnect between academic discussion and practical conduct. However, we found that the ignorance of academic literature on SISP is not primarily caused by a constrained knowledge transfer. In order to exclude communication barriers, we filtered the academic discussion according to the specific situation and the needs of FSC and translated it into practical recommendations. Nevertheless, the academic arguments we put forward hardly had any impact, either on IT managers' thinking or on SISP practice at FSC. Though academic literature was partly perceived as inspiring, it was not regarded as a touchstone for SISP practice. Academia, in the eyes of FSC's practitioners, ignores the ""real problems"" and thus is not accredited as a relevant source of advice. Moreover, in a final discussion with FSC's senior IT executives we got the impression that the professional identity of FSC's IT management - and more specifically the CIO's role - was different from interpretations prevalent in academia. The academic discussion assumes the CIO to be an initiator of organisational innovations and driver of business strategy on the board. In contrast, we found that FSC's CIO basically perceives her role as that of a service provider to business. While the different perceptions might be due to idiosyncrasies of FSC, related research provided additional empirical support for the conjecture of misleading academic assumptions about the role of IT management in practice. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Fuelled by recent technology trends numerous new E-Collaboration systems appeared in the marketplace. Today, the market offers an abundance of systems that often support a wide range of features. In this paper a study is presented that aims to shed light on the market for E-Collaboration systems by structuring the range of available systems into meaningful classes. To this end, a sample of 94 E-Collaboration systems is characterised using a classification approach. Application of a cluster analysis led to the identification of five system classes and a range of sub classes. The resulting system classes are described and trends of integration and convergence, which characterise the market, are discussed. The results, being a reflection of the existing market complexity, should be equally helpful for researchers who deal with E-Collaboration systems as their objects of interest, as well as for business executives, who need a market overview to support buying decisions.","['Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'E-Collaboration', 'Groupware', 'Market Study']",,

Potential providers of location-based services in mobile commerce have to deal with a high uncertainty regarding consumers’ acceptance and intensity of use. This paper analyses the applicability of conjoint analysis, a classical technique to identify consumer preferences in multiattribute decision making, to the design of new context sensitive services. The method is evaluated by using a fictitious example of location-based services in a touristic setting. It is concluded that despite methodological and contextual limitations conjoint analysis provides valuable insights into consumers’ preferences regarding selected attributes of the specified service. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","['conjoint analysis', 'customer integration', 'location-based services', 'mobile applications', 'mobile services', 'preference measurement', 'service development']","['Unified modeling language, Electronic government, Collaboration, Analytical models, Visualization, Context modeling, government data processing, public administration, specification languages, public administration, information system, electronic government project, model-driven development, model-to-model transformation, PICTURE language, domain-specific process modeling language, BPMN 2.0, electronic government system, block-based language, generic process modeling language']",

22267085,"Information Systems Strategy: Reconceptualization, Measurement, and Implications","Information systems strategy is of central importance to IS practice and research. Our extensive review of the literature suggests that the concept of IS strategy is a term that is used readily; however, it is also a term that is not fully understood. In this study, we follow a perspective paradigm based on the strategic management literature to define IS strategy as an organizational perspective on the investment in, deployment, use, and management of IS. Through a systematic literature search, we identify the following three conceptions of IS strategy employed implicitly in 48 articles published in leading IS journals that focus on the construct of IS strategy: (1) IS strategy as the use of IS to support business strategy; (2) IS strategy as the master plan of the IS function; and (3) IS strategy as the shared view of the IS role within the organization. We find the third conception best fits our defi-nition of IS strategy. As such, we consequently propose to operationalize IS strategy as the degree to which the organi-zation has a shared perspective to seek innovation through IS. Specifically, our proposed IS strategic typology suggests an organization's IS strategy falls into one of the two defined categories (i.e., IS innovator or IS conservative) or is simply undefined. We also develop measures for this new typology. We argue that the proposed instrument, which was cross-validated across both chief information officers and senior business executives, has the potential to serve as a diagnostic tool through which the organization can directly assess its IS strategy. We contend that our reconceptualization and operationalization of IS strategy provides theoretical and practical implications that advance the current level of understanding of IS strategy from extant studies within three predominant literature streams: strategic IS planning, IS/business strategic alignment, and competitive use of IS.","['Competitive advantage', 'IS strategic alignment', 'IS strategy', 'Strategic IS planning']",,

This paper reports on an experiment that examined the effect of activity awareness on feelings of connectedness and willingness to work in virtual teams. The results show that activity awareness indeed had a significant impact on feelings of connectedness and that the relationship between activity awareness and willingness to work was fully mediated by feelings of connectedness. Higher feelings of connectedness and willingness to work were associated with higher feelings of congeniality toward the team, which in turn were associated better team performance. Thus, we suggest that social loafing can be decreased in distributed contexts by reporting the activities of team members.",Collaboration; Social presence; Motivation Theory,"['Computer science education, Computer-supported exercises, E-assessment, Formative assessment, Hoare logic']",en
22267319,"""Don't pressure me!"" Exploring the Anatomy of Voluntariness in the Organizational Adoption of Network Technologies","The design and management of the roll-out of new IT in an organization comprises several managerial decisions, one of which is whether IT adoption should be mandatory. Voluntariness to adopt has mainly been researched as a variable in explaining individual IT acceptance, however with contradicting results. By drawing on a case study of a financial service company, we aim to expand our understanding of the notion of voluntariness. We distinguish between management's claim that adoption is voluntary (espoused voluntariness) and the perception of this claim at the employee (perceived voluntariness) and team level. Moreover we elaborate on the changing role of voluntariness in the different stages of the roll-out process of a particular network technology. This allows us to observe a dilemma presented in the case: While voluntariness initial seems to be prerequisite for implementation and technology roll-out, it may act as an inhibitor to full diffusion in later stages.",IT Adoption; Voluntariness; Real-Time Collaboration Technologies; Network Technologies; IT Roll-out Process,,en
22273732,Using the Internet for Collaborative Research in Europe – Experiences from the GARNET Virtual Network,"University research is increasingly organised in inter-organisational networks. As part of its 6th research framework, the European Commission (EC) funded a total of 130 so-called networks of excellence (NoEs), a special kind of instrument with the purpose of strengthening and developing the European research community and scientific and technological excellence by integrating existing and emerging research activities and by exchanging knowledge. In such NoEs electronic cooperation platforms are typically implemented to support collaboration between the individuals from the various research institutions. In this paper we investigate the adoption of a cooperation platform in one NoE case - the GARNET network. We find evidence that the platform is used for administrative purposes and to support the organisation of events. However, a web log analysis reveals a lack of adoption for its key purpose - the support of collaborative research and knowledge exchange. A social network analysis further uncovers that the GARNET network is fragmented on the social level, which points to a misfit between network structure and the positioning of the cooperation platform. Our findings lead us to suggest immediate next steps for this NoE and also point to general implications for network designers and future research in this area.",Research networks; Networks of Excellence (NoE); Cooperation systems; Adoption; Social Network Analysis (SNA),,en
22300418,Analysis of Network Data based on Probability Neighborhood Cliques,"The authors present the concept of a ""probability neighborhood clique"" intended to substantiate the idea of a ""community"", i.e. of a dense subregion within a (simple) network. For that purpose the notion of a clique is generalized in a probabilistic way. The probability neighborhoods employed for that purpose are indexed by one or two tuning parameters to bring out the ""degree of denseness"" respectively a hierarchy within that community. The paper, moreover, reviews other degree based concepts of communities and addresses algorithmic aspects.",,,en
22324014,Factor Preselection and Multiple Measures of Dependence,"Factor selection or factor reduction is carried out to reduce the complexity of a data analysis problems (classification, regression) or to improve the fit of a model (via parameter estimation). In data mining there are special needs for a process by which relevant factors of influence are identified in order to achieve a balance between bias and noise. Insurance companies, for example, face data sets that contain hundreds of attributes or factors per object. With a large number of factors, the selection procedure requires a suitable process model. A process like that becomes compelling once data analysis is to be (semi) automated. We suggest an approach that proceeds in two phases: In the first one, we cluster attributes that are highly correlated in order to identify factor combinations that-statistically speaking-are near duplicates. In the second phase, we choose factors from each cluster that are highly associated with a target variable. The implementation requires some form of non-linear canonical correlation analysis. We define a correlation measure for two blocks of factors that will be employed as a measure of similarity within the clustering process. Such measures, in turn, are based on multiple indices of dependence. Few indices have been introduced cf. Wolff (Stochastica 4(3):175-188, 1980), 'Few indices have been introduced in the literature'. All of them, however, are hard to interpret if the number of dimensions considerably exceeds two. For that reason we come up with signed measures that can be interpreted in the usual way. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",,"['economic theory, MMORPG, virtual economy, virtual world']",en

22332604,Supporting virtual research teams – how social network sites could contribute to the emergence of necessary social capital,"Virtual Teams in enterprise contexts have been well researched. However when concerned with scientific research studies often focus on a macro level ignoring the individual perspective of scholars. I report in this paper on observations made in two case studies on research collaboration, one concentrated on a large research network and one on the situated context of IS scholars involved in collaboration. I find that the characteristics of virtual work in enterprise and academic contexts differ notably. Whereas literature on virtual teams in enterprise contexts proclaim a strong need for the support of relational and cognitive Social Capital, in academic contexts rather structural Social Capital seems to be missing. I further propose to consider Social Network Sites as a tool to support research collaboration, as this IT-artefact seems to positively affect the emergence and maintenance of structural Social Capital.","['Research collaboration', 'Social capital', 'Social network sites']",,en
22332681,Analysing research collaboration on the micro level – the perspective of individual scholars in the IS discipline,"Virtual organisation of work is not unproblematic. An extensive body of research exists on topics like virtual teams in enterprise contexts. Similarly, in a scientific context many studies analyse collaboration among scholars. However, most studies here focus on the macro level (e.g. policy issues and the organisation of research projects). The role of the individual scholar in this is vastly ignored. I present observations from a qualitative study investigating research collaboration in taking the perspective of individual scholars in the IS discipline. I explore the different contexts of interaction in which scholars execute collaboration, and also the emergence of scholars' individual social networks. Further I analyse tool usage, specifically focusing on Social Software, which, comparable to enterprise contexts, is gaining increasing attention in the academic context. Based on my observations I present two sets of propositions aiming at the emergence of a scholar's professional social network and an adequate usage of tools for supporting collaboration.","['Research collaboration', 'Social network', 'Social software']",,en

But still GPU programming is error-prone and there are a lot of peculiarities to be considered for developing efficient GPU accelerated applications. Algorithmic skeletons encapsulate typical parallel programming patterns. They have emerged to be an efficient approach to simplifying the development of parallel and distributed applications. In this paper, we present an extension of our skeleton library Muesli in terms of GPU accelerated data parallel skeletons for multi-GPU systems and GPU clusters using CUDA. Besides the computation on the GPU, these skeletons also fully hide data transfer between different GPU devices as well as network transfer between different compute nodes.

Model-driven development is a promising concept to overcome the challenges associated with developing these systems, for example changing requirements, diverse stakeholders and evolving processes. This paper presents a model-to-model transformation between PICTURE, a domain-specific process modeling language for the public administration sector, and BPMN 2.0. The transformation can be part of the model-driven development of electronic government systems. With the building block-based language PICTURE, administration processes can be modeled in a domain-specific way under involvement of all relevant stakeholders. BPMN, as a generic process modeling language, enables the generation of detailed and executable models from PICTURE models. Besides the individual transformation rules, this paper includes an overview of the implementation with Eclipse and QVT Operational.","['Unified modeling language', 'Electronic government', 'Collaboration', 'Analytical models', 'Visualization', 'Context modeling', 'government data processing', 'public administration', 'specification languages', 'public administration', 'information system', 'electronic government project', 'model-driven development', 'model-to-model transformation', 'PICTURE language', 'domain-specific process modeling language', 'BPMN 2.0', 'electronic government system', 'block-based language', 'generic process modeling language']",,en

At the same time, the complexity of treatments has increased: patients do not understand treatment plans or fail to timely take the intended dosage of drugs. The consequence is a lack of compliance. Patients not adhering to medication plans likely face severe health problems. To support the relationship with physicians and patients' compliance, we developed the mobile platform appmedi. It helps patients to manage, which drugs they have to take, and to document their compliance to medication plans. appmedi has been designed for transplantation medicine because strict adherence is vital to save patients' lives.

22568818,A Model-Driven Approach for Enforcing Summarizability in Multidimensional Modeling,"The development of a data warehouse system is based on a conceptual multidimensional model, which provides a high level of abstraction in the accurate and expressive description of real-world situations. Once this model has been designed, the corresponding logical representation must be obtained as the basis of the implementation of the data warehouse according to one specific technology. However, there is a semantic gap between the dimension hierarchies modeled in a conceptual multidimensional model and its implementation. This gap particularly complicates a suitable treatment of summarizability issues, which may in turn lead to erroneous results from business intelligence tools. Therefore, it is crucial not only to capture adequate dimension hierarchies in the conceptual multidimensional model of the data warehouse, but also to correctly transform these multidimensional structures in a summarizability- compliant representation. A model-driven normalization process is therefore defined in this paper to address this summarizability-aware transformation of the dimension hierarchies in rich conceptual models. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,,en

22832943,[εm] – Process Analysis using a Meta Modeling Tool,"Increasing complexity in business processes and the resulting missing manageability are one of the main issues in business process management today. Process owners do not only have to keep track of one aspect of a process (e.g. The correct input and output, the efficiency or the compliance) but of combinations of these. In turn, these aspects are influenced by several possible factors through-out the whole process. Often occurring adjustments and fast changing regulations raise the complexity of monitoring even more. As the manual analysis becomes more and more infeasible, automatic analysis tools are required that support re-sponsible persons in this task. Here, our meta modeling tool [ϵm] comes into play. For analysis, [ϵm] enables the user to define specific patterns that describe issues to be detected in business process models. [ϵm] can search these issues automatically by means of an included algorithm and present the detected parts. Currently existing tools often lack a wide applicability (i.e. only support one modeling language), only allow rather simple patterns or are too difficult to use. The demo presents the flexible applicability of the tool and how it can be used by modeling experts as well as domain experts to benefit from its wide-ranging functionality. Based on a continuous example, the support of arbitrary modeling languages, the creation of complex patterns by using the graphical user interface, and the search of these patterns in business process models are presented.","['Compliance Checking', 'Meta Modeling', 'Process Analysis']",,en

22846185,A Pareto-Beneficial Sub-Tree Mutation for the Multi-Criteria Minimum Spanning Tree Problem,"While finding minimum-cost spanning trees (MST) in undirected graphs is solvable in polynomial time, the multi-criteria minimum spanning tree problem (mcMST) is NP-hard. Interestingly, the mcMST problem has not been in focus of evolutionary computation research for a long period of time, although, its relevance for real world problems is easy to see. The available and most notable approaches by Zhou and Gen as well as by Knowles and Corne concentrate on solution encoding and on fairly dated selection mechanisms. In this work, we revisit the mcMST and focus on the mutation operators as exploratory components of evolutionary algorithms neglected so far. We investigate optimal solution characteristics to discuss current mutation strategies, identify shortcomings of these operators, and propose a sub-tree based operator which offers what we term Pareto-beneficial behavior: ensuring convergence and diversity at the same time. The operator is empirically evaluated inside modern standard evolutionary meta-heuristics for multi-criteria optimization and compared to hitherto applied mutation operators in the context of mcMST.",,"['Dienstleistungsgestaltung, Digitales Einkaufserlebnis, KMU im Handel, Ko-Kreation']",en

However, in the multi-objective case, simultaneously applying different priorities for different objectives may cause severe disruptions in the genome and may lead to inferior solutions. In this paper, we combine an existing mutation operator concept with new insights from detailed observation of the structure of solutions for multi-objective machine scheduling problems. This allows the comprehensive integration of priority rules to produce better Pareto-front approximations. We evaluate the extended operator concept compared to standard swap mutation and the stand-alone components of our hybrid scheme, which performs best in all evaluated cases.",,"['Customer Service', ' Social Media', ' Twitter', ' Facebook', ' Airline Industry', ' CRM', ' Analytics']",en
22854151,Parameter Selection for Swarm Intelligence Algorithms: Case Study on Parallel Implementation of FSS,"Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as Fish School Search (FSS), are well known as useful tools that can be used to achieve a good solution in a reasonable amount of time for complex optimization problems. And when problems increase in size and complexity, some increase in population size or number of iterations might be needed in order to achieve a good solution. In extreme cases, the execution time can be huge and other approaches, such as parallel implementations, might help to reduce it. This paper investigates the relation and trade off involving these three aspects in SI algorithms, namely population size, number of iterations, and problem complexity. The results with a parallel implementations of FSS show that increasing the population size is beneficial for finding good solutions. However, we observed an asymptotic behavior of the results, i.e. increasing the population over a certain threshold only leads to slight improvements.",Parameter Selection; Swarm Intelligence; Fish School Search; Parallel Implementation; Computational Intelligence,"['Data Stream', ' Stream Clustering', ' Text Analysis', ' Text Clustering', ' Twitch.tv']",en

22867163,Learning Database Queries via Intelligent Semiotic Machines,"In the Big Data era, data-intensive and data-driven approaches are affording the paradigm change. In this data deluge, finding relevant and appropriate information is of great importance for achieving the demanding goals posed by business and society. However, traditional database search is limited by the assumption of query criteria as hard constraints. This provides results without personalization and flexibility, and often leads to information overload, i.e., non-focused results that are not informative to users. There is also often relevance misalignment, which occurs when the system only relies on consensus relevance. To overcome these problems, we present, in this work, a novel approach for (semi) automatically learning database queries based on Semiotics and Computational Intelligence techniques, in which user perception and intention are considered for interactively producing tailored queries that facilitate personalized data exploration and retrieval. In this sense, we present an empirical analysis to assess the effectiveness of our approach in learning SQL queries in a Query By Example scenario. The obtained results confirm that our approach is capable of generating SQL queries based on a single user-defined example without requiring any database-specific knowledge such as query language or database schema and structure.","['Databases', 'Semiotics', 'Automobiles', 'Self-organizing feature maps', 'Neurons', 'Training', 'Electronic mail', 'Big Data', 'database management systems', 'information retrieval', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'query languages', 'query processing', 'relational databases', 'SQL', 'SQL queries', 'database-specific knowledge', 'query language', 'database schema', 'intelligent semiotic machines', 'Big Data era', 'data-driven approaches', 'query criteria', 'hard constraints', 'information overload', 'Semiotics', 'Computational Intelligence techniques', 'tailored queries', 'data exploration', 'database search', 'data retrieval', 'database queries learning', 'information finding']",,en

22873659,Comprehensive Feature-Based Landscape Analysis of Continuous and Constrained Optimization Problems Using the R-Package flacco,"Choosing the best-performing optimizer(s) out of a portfolio of optimization algorithms is usually a difficult and complex task. It gets even worse, if the underlying functions are unknown, i.e., so-called Black-Box problems, and function evaluations are considered to be expensive. In the case of continuous single-objective optimization problems, Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) - a sophisticated and effective approach for characterizing the landscapes of such problems by means of numerical values before actually performing the optimization task itself - is advantageous. Unfortunately, until now it has been quite complicated to compute multiple ELA features simultaneously, as the corresponding code has been - if at all - spread across multiple platforms or at least across several packages within these platforms.<br />This article presents a broad summary of existing ELA approaches and introduces flacco, an R-package for feature-based landscape analysis of continuous and constrained optimization problems. Although its functions neither solve the optimization problem itself nor the related ""Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP)"", it offers easy access to an essential ingredient of the ASP by providing a wide collection of ELA features on a single platform - even within a single package. In addition, flacco provides multiple visualization techniques, which enhance the understanding of some of these numerical features, and thereby make certain landscape properties more comprehensible. On top of that, we will introduce the package's build-in, as well as web-hosted and hence platform-independent, graphical user interface (GUI), which facilitates the usage of the package - especially for people who are not familiar with R - making it a very convenient toolbox when working towards algorithm selection of continuous single-objective optimization problems.",Exploratory Landscape Analysis; R-Package; Graphical User Interface; Single-Objective Optimization; Continuous Optimization; Algorithm Selection; Black-Box Optimization,"['Airline industry, Analytics, Crm, Customer service, Facebook, Social media, Twitter']",en

The challenge is to optimize an agent to perform well on several different games, where each objective score corresponds to the performance on a different game. The benchmark is inspired from the quest for general intelligence in the form of general game playing, and builds on the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework. As it is based on game-playing, this benchmark incorporates salient aspects of game-playing problems such as discontinuous feedback and a non-trivial amount of stochasticity. We argue that the proposed benchmark thus provides a different challenge from many other benchmarks for multi-objective optimization algorithms currently available. We also provide initial results on categorizing the space offered by this benchmark and applying a standard multi-objective optimization algorithm to it.","['Multi-objective optimization', 'GVGAI', 'MCTS']","['Cross-Functional Integration', ' Teaching', ' Case Study', ' Supply Chain Integration']",en

This is inmany cases attributed to the lack of real data and knowledgeabout the component or machine under consideration.Instead, experimental data is often used for algorithmtraining, which is not able to reflect the complexity of realworldsystems. To improve prognostics and healthmanagement approaches condition data from fleets ofmachines rather than single units can be taken intoconsideration. Therefor machine conditions are assessedagainst situations encountered by machines in the same fleetand knowledge is transferred to allow algorithms tointelligently learn and improve their capabilities.Several approaches have recently been presented in theliterature, which make use of the fleet knowledge forcondition-based maintenance. These approaches are designedfor specific fleet compositions and characteristics.Therefore, in order to incorporate fleet knowledge intodiagnostic and prognostic approaches the fleet underconsideration and resulting requirements have to be analyzed.With this information, it is possible to determine whetherfleet-based approaches are applicable in general to thespecific case as well as facilitate the selection of a suitablefleet-based approach. Three types of fleets are distinguishedin the literature, namely identical, homogeneous andheterogeneous fleets. This distinction makes reference to thestructural dimension of fleets.

The advanced functionality in combination with the increased mobility has rendered devices such as smart glasses particularly suited for mobile process support. However, whereas this support is predominantly limited to information provision and workflow management, the glasses’ capability to be utilized for actual process modelling has yet to be investigated. As a first step, this paper proposes an outlook on the development of a process modelling language that is specifically tailored towards the application domain smart glasses and can be applied for both modelling and representing business processes using a glasses-based modelling environment. A demonstration case is provided to highlight the utilization of process modelling on smart glasses.","['Business process management', 'Mobile', 'Process modelling', 'Smart glasses']","['Model-Based Optimization', ' Bayesian Optimization', ' Black-Box', ' Optimization', ' Hyperparameter Tuning', ' Parameter Configuration', ' R']",en

22964951,Application of the Design Thinking Approach to Process Redesign at an Insurance Company in Brazil,"Abstract  (a) Situation faced: During the review of an information system for medical material purchasing at a Brazilian insurance company, it became clear that part of the process supported by this system was done informally and there was no consensus among the employees about some of the related fundamental concepts and procedures. (b) Action taken: A consulting firm hired by the insurance company to find a solution to these challenges proposed to use the Design Thinking approach to process redesign, by aligning the Design Thinking stages with the phases of the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle. A series of workshops that applied various Design Thinking tools was conducted with representatives from all of the company&rsquo;s departments that deal with the purchasing process, as well as a team of information technology (IT) professionals. (c) Results achieved: The Design Thinking approach facilitated the following outcomes: (1) formalization of the employees&rsquo; perceptions regarding the existing purchasing process, (2) design of a to-be process for material purchasing, which was approved by all stakeholders, and (3) formalization of requirements for the new information system for managing the material-purchasing process. (d) Lessons learned: The case demonstrated the value of applying the Design Thinking approach to process redesign and improvement, adding useful instruments for BPM analysis. The BPM lifecycle phases correspond well with the Design Thinking stages, and Design Thinking techniques match BPM&rsquo;s social-construction viewpoint well.","['Case Studies', 'BPM', 'Business Process Management', 'Teaching Cases', 'Professional Cases', 'Real-World BPM Cases']",,en

Over the years, many different solution approaches and solvers have been developed. For the first time, we directly compare five state-of-the-art inexact solvers— namely, LKH, EAX, restart variants of those, and MAOS—on a large set of well-known benchmark instances and demonstrate complementary performance, in that different instances may be solved most effectively by different algorithms. We leverage this complementarity to build an algorithm selector, which selects the best TSP solver on a perinstance basis and thus achieves significantly improved performance compared to the single best solver, representing an advance in the state of the art in solving the Euclidean TSP. Our in-depth analysis of the selectors provides insight into what drives this performance improvement.","['Automated algorithm selection', 'Machine learning', 'Performance modeling', 'Travelling salesperson problem']",,en

However, due to the difficult to collect trust-related data from industry, given its concerns surrounding privacy and trade secret protection, it still very problematic to investigate it. Motivated by the growing interest in behavioral research in the field of operations and supply chain management, and by the lack of supply chain trust-related datasets, the authors of this paper proposed and designed a novel trust behavioral experiment. Utilizing concepts of gamification and serious games, the experiment is capable of gathering information regarding individuals’ behavior during procurement, information exchange, and ordering decisions considering trust relations in the context of supply chains.","['Behavioral experiment', 'Gamification', 'Supply chains', 'Trust']",,en
22969252,Leveraging social media to gain insights into service delivery: a study on Airbnb,"Consumers increasingly rely on reviews and social media posts provided by others to get information about a service. Especially in the Sharing Economy, the quality of service delivery varies widely; no common quality standard can be expected. Because of the rapidly increasing number of reviews and tweets regarding a particular service, the available information becomes unmanageable for a single individual. However, this data contains valuable insights for platform operators to improve the service and educate individual providers. Therefore, an automated tool to summarize this flood of information is needed. Various approaches to aggregating and analyzing unstructured texts like reviews and tweets have already been proposed. In this research, we present a software toolkit that supports the sentiment analysis workflow informed by the current state-of-the-art. Our holistic toolkit embraces the entire process, from data collection and filtering to automated analysis to an interactive visualization of the results to guide researchers and practitioners in interpreting the results. We give an example of how the tool works by identifying positive and negative sentiments from reviews and tweets regarding Airbnb and delivering insights into the features of service delivery its users most value and most dislike. In doing so, we lay the foundation for learning why people participate in the Sharing Economy and for showing how to use the data. Beyond its application on the Sharing Economy, the proposed toolkit is a step toward providing the research community with an instrument for a holistic sentiment analysis of individual domains of interest.",Social media analysis; Sentiment analysis; Sharing Economy; Service delivery,,en

In the top dogs' slipstream resides a variety of less-known platforms that allow to share different resources or to share resources in different ways. Researchers who study these platforms and the underlying consumer behaviors face the problem of situating their findings precisely. Practitioners lack an overview of the diversity of these platforms and their characteristics too. This article suggests a taxonomy that helps to better characterize platforms for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing and Collaborative Consumption (SCC). We used the taxonomy to describe the evolution of 522 P2P SCC platforms over the period of 35months and to demonstrate and partly evaluate its application. All descriptions taken together constitute a comprehensive data source to study P2P SCC platforms. When researchers use the taxonomy, they can describe and situate insights precisely so that stakeholders can access them more easily. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners can use our database as well as the analyses we made based on the data for their purpose. Because we deliver the computer scripts that we used in our analysis, our study can easily be reproduced in the future to investigate the dynamics of the P2P SCC market.",Taxonomy; Sharing Economy; Collaborative Consumption; P2P; Peer-to-Peer Platforms; Reproducible research,"['Automated unit tests generation, Database applications, Java enterprise edition, Java persistence API, Symbolic execution']",en
22969667,From One-Stop-Shop to No-Stop-Shop: An E-Government Stage Model,"This paper responds to two observations regarding current government service delivery. First, despite reasonable efforts to improve the design of forms and to establish single points of contacts in the course of one-stop-shops, citizens still perceive forms as cumbersome. Second, citizens expect governments to act more proactively by initiating relevant government services themselves instead of relying on a manual trigger from the citizen. To overcome these two issues, this paper proposes the transition from a one-stop-shop to a no-stop-shop, where the citizen has to perform no action and to fill no form to receive a government service. The contribution of this paper is an e-government stage model to guide the transition from a one-stop-shop to a no-stop-shop. It describes the three stages of government service delivery ""One-Stop-Shop"", ""Limited No-Stop-Shop"" and ""No-Stop-Shop"" according to the dimensions ""Integration of Data Collection"", ""Integration of Data Storage"" and ""Purpose of Data Use"". The stage model is exemplarily applied to a real-world case. An initial evaluation of the stage model is executed through discussions with researchers and semi-structured interviews with government employees.","['E-Government', 'Forms', 'No-Stop-Shop', 'One-Stop-Shop', 'Proactive government', 'Public administration']","['Stream Clustering', ' Online Clustering', ' Data Streams']",en
22969746,Will Government Forms Ever be Consistent? Detecting Violations in Form Structures by Utilizing Graph Theory,"Forms play an important role in government service delivery since they are the central interface between the government and its citizens. However, due to the multiplicity of forms, their management in governments is complex. To assist governments in the initial form development and regular maintenance of forms, the contribution of this paper is a semi-automatic approach that identifies potential structural inconsistencies or other violations in a set of forms. The approach is based on graph theory to represent forms in a machine-readable format and to analyze them semi-automatically. While the phase ""Form Transformation"" deals with the abstraction of forms by means of model structures, the ""Pattern Specification"" comprises the creation of an issue to search for in a machine-readable format. Eventually, in the course of the ""Form Checking"", the actual pattern search within the form is executed. We introduce the approach conceptually and demonstrate it in a real-world case by means of its implementation within a software tool and three exemplary issues in form structures. Based on this practical applicability, the approach aims at providing governments with support for reducing inconsistencies or flaws in forms to improve governments' processes, save time and reduce effort and expenses.","['E-Government', 'Forms', 'Model Query', 'Patterns', 'Public Administration']",,en
22972761,Design and Development of an Event-driven In-memory Business Process Engine,"Although organizations have widely adopted Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) as an automation and integration middleware, these systems remain limited in their orchestration capabilities. BPMS can only react to event information that enterprise applications emit and only integrate against the service interfaces these applications provide. At the same time, organizations increasingly leverage large-scale in-memory database platforms as a shared database layer to house all their enterprise applications. These databases challenge traditional three-tier architectures by relocating data-intense application code into the data-tier. Consequently, the database contains both application data and low-level service procedures, which make up the required inputs for an orchestration capability.This paper presents the design and development of an event-oriented Business Process Engine (BPE) that runs within an in-memory platform. The approach comprises a compiler which transforms processes modeled in BPMN 2.0 into artifacts of the in-memory database, and the actual BPE that is implemented in the database platform's procedural programming language. The approach provides unconstrained reach to external events, which are expressed as arbitrary database state changes. Using BPMN as input, this paper addresses the notation's poorly specified message semantics to declare events by clarifying the notion of messages w.r.t the BPE and the message properties of BPMN. Special consideration is on message correlation and messaging patterns toward messaging scenarios far beyond the narrow BPMN specification.","['BPMN', 'Business Process Execution', 'Event-driven Business Process Management', 'In-memory Database', 'Workflow Management']","['Omni-Channel CRM', ' Big Data', ' Customer Segmentation', ' Data Architecture']",en

22999113,Repainting the Business Model Canvas for Peer-to-Peer Sharing and Collaborative Consumption,Sharing Economy businesses have become very popular recently but there is little guidance available on how to develop the respective business models. We faced this problem during a consortium research project for developing a service for electric vehicle charging that adopts the paradigm of Peer-to-Peer Sharing and Collaborative Consumption (P2P SCC)—a specific branch of the Sharing Economy. We use Action Design Research (ADR) to develop an adapted version of the Business Model Canvas that is specifically tailored to the needs of P2P SCC business model development. The adapted canvas is then applied to develop a business model for the proposed service. The learnings from the development process are formalized into a set of generally applicable guidelines for the development of P2P SCC business models. The resulting guidelines and the adapted canvas provide guidance for both researchers and practitioners who want to either develop new or analyze existing P2P SCC business models.,"['Action design research', 'Business Model Canvas', 'Business models', 'Collaborative consumption', 'Peer-to-peer sharing', 'Sharing economy']","['Business process modelling, EPC, Modelling support, Procedure model, User support']",en

Several approaches exist for solving this problem using exact and heuristic techniques, however all of them use a single objective function for determining an optimal solution. We propose a multi-objective approach based on a simulated annealing heuristic so that repositioning coordinators can better balance profit making with cost-savings and environmental sustainability. As the first multi-objective approach in the area of liner shipping routing, we show that giving more options to decision makers need not be costly. Indeed, our approach requires no extra runtime than a weighted objective heuristic and provides a rich set of solutions along the Pareto front.",,,en

23013909,An open-data approach for quantifying the potential of taxi ridesharing,"Taxi ridesharing (TRS), also known as shared taxi or collective taxi, is an advanced form of public transportation with flexible routing and scheduling that matches at least two separate ride requests with similar spatio-temporal characteristics in real-time to a jointly used taxi, driven by an employed driver without own destination. TRS, therefore, differs from private ridesharing, which refers to sharing of rides among private people. TRS is a more restricted dynamic dial-a-ride problem, which considers the requirements of both multiple passengers and the service provider. Because of the pooled simultaneous utilization of a taxi, TRS is collaborative consumption. [This definition has been pasted from the paper, Section 2.2. References are provided there] (TRS) is an advanced form of urban transportation that matches separate ride requests with similar spatio-temporal characteristics to a jointly used taxi. As collaborative consumption, TRS saves customers money, enables taxi companies to economize use of their resources, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. We develop a one-to-one TRS approach that matches rides with similar start and end points. We evaluate our approach by analyzing an open dataset of &gt; 5 million taxi trajectories in New York City. Our empirical analysis reveals that the proposed approach matches up to 48.34% of all taxi rides, saving 2,892,036 km of travel distance, 231,362.89 l of gas, and 532,134.64 kg of CO2 emissions per week. Compared to many-to-many TRS approaches, our approach is competitive, simpler to implement and operate, and poses less rigid assumptions on data availability and customer acceptance.",Taxi ridesharing; Collaborative consumption; Transportation; Open data; Sustainability; Shared mobility,"['Disaster management', ' situation awareness', ' machine learning', ' information systems']",en
23022744,flaccogui: Exploratory Landscape Analysis for Everyone,"Finding the optimal solution for a given problem has always been an intriguing goal and a key for reaching this goal is sound knowledge of the problem at hand. In case of single-objective, continuous, global optimization problems, such knowledge can be gained by Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA), which computes features that quantify the problem's landscape prior to optimization. Due to the various backgrounds of researches that developed such features, there nowadays exist numerous implementations of feature sets across multiple programming languages, which is a blessing and burden at the same time. Therecently developed R-package flacco takes multiple of these feature sets (from the different packages and languages) and combines them within a single R-package. While this is very beneficial for R-users, users of other programming languages are left out. Within this paper, we introduce flaccogui, a graphical user interface that does not only make flacco more user-friendly, but due to a platform-independent web-Application also allows researchers that are not familiar with R to perform ELA and benefit of the advantages of flacco.",Exploratory Landscape Analysis; Graphical User Interface; R-Package; Continuous Optimization; Automated Algorithm Selection,"['Informationsmanagement', ' Information Management', ' Management des IT/IS Betriebs', ' IT/IS Operations Management', ' IT-Service Management', ' IT Service Management']",en

Decision support systems (DSSs) can be implemented to identify the best second life scenario for which to repurpose individual batteries. However, the properties of EVBs as used products can cause information asymmetries that challenge or even disrupt the market for used EVBs. Providing value-added services with used EVBs is one strategy to mitigate the information asymmetry. Guided by seven design principles, we develop and demonstrate a vertical software prototype for configuring energy storage solutions (ESSs), consisting of used EVBs and value-added services. Core of the system is an item-based collaborative filtering recommender system.

Ever better apps keep propelling the proliferation of mobile computing. App development is rather easy, particularly if it is based on Web technology. However, implementing apps that are user friendly and useful in the long-run is cumbersome. Thereby, it typically is expensivefor corporate developers. Nonetheless, business apps are embraced by enterprises. To overcome the overhead of developing separately for multiple platforms and to mitigate the problems of device fragmentation, crossplatform development approaches are employed. While many such approaches exist, few have found widespread usage. In this chapter, we argue what the path towards future solutions could look like. We thereby take a rather technological look, but always keep business-orientation in mind. Our findings suggest that much effort is needed to enable the next generations of business apps. However, such apps will provide many merits and possibilities.

23262212,A Semi-Automated Content Moderation Workflow for Humanitarian Situation Assessments,"Although online social media has been recognized as a source of information that is potentiallyrelevant for humanitarian organizations, it remains to demonstrate positive impact. The authors arguethat relevant information isn't yet incorporated effectively into decision-making because the keyrole of humanitarian situation assessment experts and their methodologies hasn't been sufficientlyrecognized and incorporated into information systems design. In particular, the authors focus onthe content moderation process (i.e. on examining, correcting and enriching data and controlling itsdissemination) and argue that existing systems, which often follow a human-is-the-loop approach,either lack automation support or flexibility. In contrast, they present an interactive, semi-automatedcontent moderation workflow and an instantiating prototype that follows the human-is-the-loopapproach and centers on assessment experts. The evaluation of the new system practitioner interviewsand serious games suggests that it offers good compatibility with experts' work practices, moderationquality and flexibility.Keywords",Disaster management; situation awareness; machine learning; information systems,"['ITIL', ' IT Service', ' software requirements engineering']",en

So far for smartphones and tablets alone, issues such as device fragmentation are discussed and technology for cross-platform development is scrutinized. Increasingly, app-enabled devices appear to be a jungle: It becomes harder to keep the overview, to distinguish and categorize devices, and to investigate similarities and differences. We, thus, set out with this position paper to close this gap. In our view, a taxonomy for app-enabled devices is required.

Repurposing electric vehicle batteries for second-life application scenarios may lower the vehicles' total costs of ownership and increases their ecologic sustainability. However, identifying the best-or even a feasible-scenario for which to repurpose a battery is a complex and unresolved decision problem. In this exaptation research, we set out to design, implement, and evaluate the first decision support system that aids decision-makers in the automobile industry with repurposing electric vehicle batteries. The exaptation is done by classifying decisions on repurposing products as bipartite matching problems and designing two binary integer linear programs that identify (a) all technical feasible assignments and (b) optimal assignments of products and scenarios. Based on an empirical study and expert interviews, we parametrize both binary integer linear programs for repurposing electric vehicle batteries. In a field experiment, we show that our decision support system considerably increases the decision quality in terms of hit rate, miss rate, precision, fallout, and accuracy. While practitioners can use the implemented decision support system when repurposing electric vehicle batteries, other researchers can build on our results to design decision support systems for repurposing further products.",Model-Driven Decision Support System; Design Science Research; Binary Integer Linear Programming; Bipartite Matching Problem; Electric Vehicle Battery,"['fault diagnostic, imbalanced data sets, machine condition monitoring, maintenance']",en

For this purpose, we evaluate a set of 69 forms of 27 German municipalities according to various criteria.

Thus, algorithmic skeletons have been proposed to provide well-defined programming patterns in order to assist programmers and shield them from low-level aspects. As the complexity of problems, and consequently the need for computing capacity, grows, we have directed our research toward simultaneous CPU-GPU execution of data parallel skeletons to achieve a performance gain. GPUs are optimized with respect to throughput and designed for massively parallel computations. Nevertheless, we analyze whether the additional utilization of the CPU for data parallel skeletons in the Muenster Skeleton Library leads to speedups or causes a reduced performance, because of the smaller computational capacity of CPUs compared to GPUs. We present a C++ implementation based on a static distribution approach. In order to evaluate the implementation, four different benchmarks, including matrix multiplication, N-body simulation, Frobenius norm, and ray tracing, have been conducted. The ratio of CPU and GPU execution has been varied manually to observe the effects of different distributions. The results show that a speedup can be achieved by distributing the execution among CPUs and GPUs. However, both the results and the optimal distribution highly depend on the available hardware and the specific algorithm.",High-level parallel programming; Data parallel algorithmic skeletons; Simultaneous CPU–GPU execution,,en

23518566,The Sharing Economy Meets the Semantic Web: An Ontology for the Matchmaking of Peers,"The Sharing Economy with the central theme of 'access over ownership' gains popularity and is receiving a lot of coverage by the media.

Besides those prominent companies, there are platforms that facilitate the sharing of tools, miscellaneous types of equipment, 3D printers and even pets. A peer searching for a specific resource to borrow needs to at first identify relevant websites and then look through various offers to find an appropriate one. This laborious process can be eased by making use of Semantic Web technologies. Using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), we synthesize the characteristics of various exemplary Sharing Economy websites with regard to the description of resources and services that can be shared including the transaction details and other relevant components. Following up, core concepts serving as a foundation for the conceptualization and the design of a description language in the form of an ontology are derived. The description language is based on Semantic Web technologies to enable efficient semantic search and matchmaking using established standards like RDF(S), OWL, and SPARQL. The underlying idea is to abstract from proprietary implementations in order to provide a common ground for service description in the domain of the Sharing Economy. Thus, a search against multiple websites could be facilitated to improve the discoverability and comparability of individual offers on different websites.","['Collaborative Consumption', 'Description Language', 'Ontology', 'Semantic Web', 'Sharing Economy']",,en

The laws designate authorities to collect breach reports and advise firms. We devise a principal-agent model to analyze the economic effect of mandatory security breach reporting to authorities. The model assumes that firms (agents) have few incentives to unilaterally report breaches. To enforce the law, regulators (principals) can introduce security audits and sanction noncompliance. However, audits cannot differentiate between concealment and nescience of the agents. Even under optimistic assumptions regarding the effectiveness of mandatory security breach reporting to authorities in reducing individual losses, our model predicts that it may be difficult to adjust the sanction level such that breach notification laws generate social benefit.",,,en
23523950,"A Requirements Engineering Process for User Centered IT Services - 
Gathering Service Requirements for the University of the Future
","Since the mid-90s, the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a so-called best practice standard, has attracted much attention from practitioners as well as academia, where the ideas of ITIL have been discussed under the label of IT Service Management (ITSM). At the core of ITIL/ITSM is the idea of a service orientation for IT service providers that support business activities of employees (the ""users"") and thus provide a value for the organization they are working for (the ""customer""). Thus, IT services won't exist without the customers' business needs and are therefore ""customer-oriented"". Although the idea of service orientation seems appealing, the introduction of ITSM in organizations is a tough endeavor and many organizations struggle even at the first steps of such an introduction. One of the issues, organizations have to deal with, is the collection of potential service candidates and especially the gathering of concrete requirements for those. The reason for this is two-folded: on the one hand, employees of IT service providers are often thinking more in technical assets rather than in value for the customer/user. They therefore often misinterpret the term ""IT service"" as the bare delivery of IT components. On the other hand, customers and users are often not able to clearly formulate their requirements in a way that the service provider is able to define an IT service out of those. This is even recognized by standards like the ITIL, which refer to the adoption of methods from software requirements engineering (SRE) to solve this issue. While this looks promising on a first sight, those methods have not been tested for IT services in the sense of ITSM. This is, what we did in a joint project with the data center of the University of Muenster in Germany (ZIV). ZIV is the central supplier of IT infrastructure for the whole university, powering the work of around 45.000 students and 8.000 scientific as well as non-scientific employees. In 2016, the ZIV management started an ITSM initiative and - in particular - focused on the creation of an IT service catalogue. Beside the intention to get a complete overview about and to standardize the currently delivered service offerings, a further goal was to question the currently offered set of services and to investigate the demand for new services, to address the changes that the digital transformation with the ever more pervasive use of information technology creates for the support for teaching and learning in higher education (e.g. time-shifted learning via podcasts, digital materials and annotation or real-time interaction in class).At that point in the project, we faced the same issues as described above: users were not able to formulate their requirements for new services in a structured manner and therefore, we set up a sub-project to evaluate the recommendation to use SRE methods for this.In a first step, a comparison of specific characteristics of software and IT services has been done to find out where they differ and if IT services might eventually be suitable for being used with SRE processes. In a further step, a literature review has been conducted to identify possible SRE processes with their methods and a checklist has been developed to check which methods might address IT services and their specific characteristics at best. Based on this, we designed workshops to test a prototypical process for SRE use in the field of ITSM. Also, we wanted to identify and develop requirements for specific new services in the area of IT-supported learning. We afterwards conducted three workshops with different student groups: one groupof first semester students and two groups of advanced students, each comprised of 5-8 people. These groups were asked to conduct the full process of requirements engineering under supervision of a researcher, who was introducing the methods and acted as a moderator, but was not taking an active part in the discussion and the development of the requirements. Based on the results of the workshops, a service requirements specification for a user centered service has been derived, including relevant information like the corresponding customer, user, supported business processes, functionalities, customer value to be generated and possible variants. The specification was then presented to the university data center staff to see if a first definition for a new IT service could be created based on it. Afterwards, this service definition has been presented to the students again to validate, if the resulting service fulfills their actual requirements and is therefore suiting their needs.",ITIL; IT Service; software requirements engineering,,en

Although automated feedback and grading for creative question types is a complex endeavor, more and more tools are developed to support e-assessment for miscellaneous question types. This paper focuses on an automated assessment of UML class diagrams. While there are already tools which support the analysis of student solutions for UML class diagrams, they only provide feedback on a low level. This paper motivates a need for assessing advanced computer science skills. For this, an analysis of student exams is conducted, focusing on exams which instruct the student to choose an appropriate design pattern for a given use case. Further, a prototype is presented which allows for an identification of design patterns, as a first step of a UML assessment tool. For this purpose, an algorithm for error-tolerant subgraph isomorphisms is adopted and extended which deals with multiple design patterns at the same time in order to match them to the students' solutions. Since it is possible to model design patterns in different sizes, a pattern template notation is presented which enables to specify the possible variants of each design pattern. A new algorithm then translates the pattern templates to be understood by the adopted matching algorithm. Finally, the identification process is evaluated empirically, showing the merits and the limitations of this approach.",UML class diagrams; design patterns; formative e-assessment,"['condition monitoring information, control of networks, integrated planning, inventory management, optimization, service personnel capacity planning, Spare parts management, transport planning']",en

Mutations of known diseases repeatedly infected large portions of the population. In order to support the select appropriate mechanisms to help taming the spread of an epidemic, several simulation approaches have been developed to forecast the propagation behavior of diseases. Agent-based micro simulations promise to create the most detailed and accurate forecasts, but require a high modeling effort. In this paper we propose an approach to lessen this modeling effort by introducing a method that automatically creates agents for representing groups within the population based on multiple data sources (e.g. census data, vaccinations records, etc.). Our approach also facilitates combining these heterogeneous data with geographic information systems as well as dealing with incomplete data for enabling automatic and scalable creation of epidemics models for different simulation purposes in epidemiology.

23627167,Employing order allocation flexibility in cyber-physical production systems,"One of the main goals of Industrie 4.0 research is to enable the usage of so far unutilized flexibility potentials in production and logistics. While Industrie 4.0 research generally considers most flexibility types, such as material handling flexibility, machine flexibility and operation flexibility, order allocation flexibility in particular is so far rarely investigated. Order allocation flexibility describes the flexibility potential that occurs when half-finished goods are not assigned to a specific customer order in a production system employing the make-to-order strategy, but instead can be freely assigned to any order that might require this half-finished good with its current specifications. Furthermore, this allocation from half-finished goods to orders might even change during the production process. Employing order allocation flexibility directly increases the degree of freedom for the other aforementioned flexibility types and has therefore already found application in the production of customer specific goods, e.g. in the form of a multi-phased order release in the automotive industry. In this context, cyber physical production systems with their capability of self-optimization and control theoretically offer the possibility to determine the allocation of half-finished goods to orders in near real time during any production step, leading to a further increase of flexibility in the overall production system. This work contributes to the state of the art in Industrie 4.0 research by first analyzing the potentials of a stronger consideration of order allocation flexibility into Industrie 4.0 enabled production systems and discussing the compatibility of existing research approaches with this flexibility type. Second, a conceptual model for production planning and control employing order allocation flexibility in a cyber-physical production system will be derived.","['flexibility', 'Industrie 4.0', 'production control', 'production planning']","['crisis management', ' VGI', ' crisis communication']",en

This paper aims to experimentally examine how trust can be assessed over different dimensions and then be used to support decision-making in order to reduce the Bullwhip Effect, which is one of the biggest efficiency problems shown by supply chains of highly interconnected organizations. As industry is generally reluctant to provide data due to privacy concerns and trade secret protection, the authors of this paper, designed and conducted a web-based trust behavioral experiment. The data collected was used to evaluate the proposed trust mechanism through an Agent-Based Social Simulation. The results revealed that it is possible to infer trust relationships from behavioral experiments and historical based data, and use these relationships to influence the procurement, ordering and information sharing process. Although additional research is still necessary, the preliminary results revealed that the use of computational trust mechanisms can be helpful to lower the Bullwhip Effect.","['ABSS', 'Behavior Modeling.', 'Behavioral Experiment', 'Bullwhip Effect', 'Social Simulation', 'Trust']",,en
23634717,Automated Scalable Modeling for Population Microsimulations,"The propagation of diseases within the population is an ever-reappearing hot topic in news stories. Mutations of known diseases repeatedly infected large portions of the population. In order to support the select appropriate mechanisms to help taming the spread of an epidemic, several simulation approaches have been developed to forecast the propagation behavior of diseases. Agent-based micro simulations promise to create the most detailed and accurate forecasts, but require a high modeling effort. In this paper we propose an approach to lessen this modeling effort by introducing a method that automatically creates agents for representing groups within the population based on multiple data sources (e.g. census data, vaccinations records, etc.). Our approach also facilitates combining these heterogeneous data with geographic information systems as well as dealing with incomplete data for enabling automatic and scalable creation of epidemics models for different simulation purposes in epidemiology. Two test cases were used to assess the proposition.","['Disease propagation', 'Grouping problems', 'Influenza Models', 'Microsimulation', 'Synthetic population']",,en

23635257,An evaluation of forecasting methods for anticipating spare parts demand.,"In the planning process of a supply chain, demand forecast have an important role in planning process of a company. The forecasts have to be as accurate as possible in order to allow the optimization of production, avoiding extra stocking costs or lost sales. In the case of spare parts, the challenge arises as the demand presents intermittent behavior. Nowadays, many forecast techniques, namely ARIMA models and Croston's method, are used to forecast spare parts demand. Alternatively to statistical methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are also powerful tools for solving non linear complex problems. Recurrent neural networks, such as the reservoir computing (RC), present an architecture that allows modeling of dynamic behavior, making it a strong candidate for solving the spare parts demand forecast problem. This work proposes a performance evaluation of artificial neural networks (feed-forward and recurrent) for spare parts demand forecasting, including also a comprehensive comparison of best achieving techniques, such as Croston's and the ARIMA method. The evaluation performed here may help an organization to decide which technique suits better its needs for forecasting the spare parts demand. The experiments show that neural networks out perform the statistical methods in three out of four data sets tested.",autoregressive moving average processes; feedforward neural nets; maintenance engineering; recurrent neural nets; supply and demand; ARIMA method; artificial neural networks; autoregressive integrated moving average model; demand forecasting methods; feed-forward neural networks; recurrent neural networks; spare parts demand anticipation; Biological system modeling; Computational modeling; Forecasting; Mathematical model; Predictive models; Recurrent neural networks; Reservoirs; ARIMA; Artificial Neural Networks; Croston's Method; Demand Forecas; Reservoir Computing; Spare Parts Demand,,en
23635339,The use of multimodal interaction for supporting the production of location-based information,"Despite the increasingly volume of location-based information systems, it is a common practice to develop these technological resources aiming for the usage by professional content providers. Non-experts users appear as an important alternative of impartial contributions in this scenario. In this manner, multimodal interaction particularly, gestures recognition and voice commands can open further opportunities for support the usage by common users. This paper therefore aims to analyze the contributions on the use of multimodal interaction for supporting the production of location-based information. Its research methodology is based on a conceptual framework as well as usability analysis with real users. The results revealed that non-experts users often take a while before becoming confident with new kinds of interaction. It also shown that voice commands were rather more useful than gestures according to the users. Furthermore, even with long years of research in the field, technological resources still need improvements for the speech and gesture recognitions, mainly due to the idiosyncrasies presented on this interaction. Although additional research is still necessary in this area, it can be concluded that multimodal interactions have a great potential for supporting the production of location-based information.",gesture recognition; information systems; speech recognition; voice communication; gesture recognition; location-based information systems; multimodal interaction; professional content providers; speech recognitions; voice commands; Gesture recognition; Global Positioning System; Production; Speech; Speech recognition; Twitter; Usability; Gesture recognition; Location-based Information; Multimodal interactions; Speech recognition; Usability Analysis,,other

The optimal siting and sizing of charging infrastructure is a major issue of electric mobility. In this context, the analysis of charging transaction data is a promising means to identify regions with lacking charging infrastructure as well as to learn about utilization and patterns in the charging behavior. Additionally, charging transaction data yields potential to learn about battery degradation when combined with state-of-health readings. To exploit the full potential of analytical assessment of charging transaction data, the enrichment of the data to integrate background as well as environmental information from various sources, e.g., weather and location data, is discussed. Different perspectives for analytics of charging transactions are motivated and preliminary findings are presented that motivate further research in this area.","['analytics', 'battery degradation', 'Electric mobility', 'EV charging behavior', 'EV charging demand', 'location-based data']",,en

23651062,Improving the Involvement of Digital Volunteers in Disaster Management,"Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has been seen as useful information in times of disasters. Several authors have shown that VGI is useful for coping with preparedness and response phases of disaster management. However, because it is still a young technology, the use of VGI remains uncertain, due to its lack of strong reliability and validity. It is our assumption that to improve reliability and validity the promotion of citizen engagement (CE) is needed. CE is not new topic, but in the digital humanitarian context, it involves important factors that are not yet considered by disaster managers, such as communication processes, motivation of volunteers, different media for production of information, etc. To fill this gap, we identified a set of preliminary factors which should be considered to promote the involvement of volunteers in disaster management. These factors were derived from critical review of CE literature and from an analysis of lessons learned from an experiment on interaction with citizens carried out in context of the EU-project “DRIVER – Driving Innovation in Crisis Management for European Resilience”.",crisis management; VGI; crisis communication,,en

23651992,Enhancing Decision Space Diversity in Evolutionary Multiobjective Algorithms,"In multi-criterion optimization, Pareto-optimal solutions that appear very similar in the objective space may have very different pre-images. In many practical applications the decision makers, who select a solution or preferred region on the Pareto-front, may want to know different pre-images of the selected solutions. Especially, this will be the case when they would like to present alternative design candidates in later stages of a multidisciplinary design process. In this paper we extend an existing CMA-ES niching framework, which has been previously applied successfully to multi-modal optimization, to the multi-criterion domain for boosting decision space diversity. At the same time, we introduce the concept of space aggregation for diversity maintenance in the aggregated spaces, i.e. search/decision and objective space. Empirical results on synthetic multi-modal bi-criteria test problems with known efficient sets and Pareto-fronts demonstrate that the diversity in the decision space can be significantly enhanced without hampering the convergence to a precise and diverse Pareto front approximation in the objective space of the original algorithm. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,,en

23652160,Experimental Analysis of Optimization Algorithms: Tuning and Beyond,"This chapter comprises the essence of several years of tutorials the authors gave on experimental research in evolutionary computation. We highlight the renaissance of experimental techniques also in other fields to especially focus on the specific conditions of experimental research in computer science, or more concretely,metaheuristic optimization. The experimental setup is discussed together with the pitfalls awaiting the unexperienced (and sometimes even the experienced). We present a severity criterion as a meta statistical concept for evaluating statistical inferences, which can be used to avoid fallacies, i.e., misconceptions resulting from incorrect reasoning in argumentation caused by floor or ceiling effects. The sequential parameter optimization is discussed as a meta statistical framework which integrates concepts such as severity. Parameter tuning is considered as a relatively new tool in method design and analysis, and it leads to the question of adaptability of optimization algorithms. Another branch of experimentation aims at attaining more concrete problem knowledge, we may term it “exploratory landscape analysis”, containing sample and visualization techniques that are often applied but not seen as being a methodological contribution. However, this chapter is not only a renarration of well-known facts.We also attempt to look into the future to estimate what the hot topics of methodological research will be in the coming years and what changes we may expect for the whole community.",,,en

23653296,To Model or Not to Model: Controlling Pac-Man Ghosts Without Incorporating Global Knowledge,"The creation of interesting opponents for human players in computer games is an interesting and challenging task. In contrast to up-to-date computer games, e.g. real time strategy games, learning of non-player-character strategies for older games seems to be easier and not that time-consuming. This way, older games, like the famous arcade game Pac-Man, serve as a test bed for the creation of strategies that are fun to play against. The paper at hand uses computational intelligence methods to accomplish this challenge, namely evolutionary algorithms (EA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The latter are trained on a model of the game whereas the EA learn good behavior by playing. The performance of these two approaches is compared on the original Pac-Man level as well as on other maps with different properties to test the ability of generalizing the learned strategies. © 2008 IEEE.",,,en

In the ten runs performed, the SMS-EMOA reliably finds good compromise solutions, as well as selfish optima that are comparable in quality to the ones previously obtained by means of the CMA-ES for each particular track. We further analyze how to select parameter set(s) for the controller from the results of the evolutionary optimization, for the case that a controller has the chance to further finetune its behavior on an unknown track, as it is done in the warinup phase of the Simulated Car Racing Championship. Experimental results show that one parameter set is not sufficient. To perform well, a controller as Mr. Racer needs at least two different parameter sets from which it can choose in the warinup stage. The best performance is gained by using three parameter sets, which leads to an increase in championship points of 17% compared to the 2013 version of Mr. Racer.",,"['Benchmarking, E-Government, Process management, Process model merging, Reference modeling']",en

One application area where diversity is essential is multimodal optimization with its goal of finding a diverse set of either globally or locally optimal solutions of a single-objective problem. We therefore investigate multiobjective selection methods that identify good quality and diverse solutions from a larger set of candidates. Simultaneously, unary quality indicators from multiobjective optimization also turn out to be useful for multimodal optimization. We focus on experimentally detecting the best selection operators and indicators in two different contexts, namely a one-time subset selection and an iterative application in optimization. Experimental results indicate that certain design decisions generally have advantageous tendencies regarding run time and quality. One such positive example is using a concept of nearest better neighbors instead of the common nearest-neighbor distances.",Benchmarking; Multimodal optimization; Multiobjectivization; Nearest neighbor; Quality indicator; Selection,,en

23681032,An Overview of Useful Data and Analyzing Techniques for Improved Multivariate Diagnostics and Prognostics in Condition-Based Maintenance,"The reliability of production machines gains in importance in today's optimized and highly productive business environments. Unexpected machine breakdowns do not only lead to loss of production time and production outages but also to diminishing customer satisfaction due to deterioration in quality and declining availability of products. The condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategy aims at preventing these machine breakdowns through real-time monitoring of machine conditions. Sensor data are collected and analyzed using diagnostic and prognostic approaches to identify the type of fault and the remaining useful life. Identifying the reasons and time of breakdowns fosters improved planning of maintenance and spare parts demand, leading to higher machine reliability. In general, machine sensor data are regarded as a useful source of information to assess the machine's operating condition. However, in some specific cases, the machine sensors lack the ability to correctly represent the health of the machine or the specific component under consideration. Therefore, additional information by further available data is required to improve diagnostic and prognostic techniques for more accurate and precise analysis. Current research focuses on the analysis of sensor data for condition-based maintenance, while other data like the operating history and environment temperature have only been considered to a limited extend so far. Hence, this paper gives an overview on potential data for machine health assessment and remaining useful life prediction in condition-based maintenance. Furthermore, corresponding approaches and techniques for fault diagnostics and prognostics are presented targeting the analysis of individual data sources as well as of multivariate settings featuring multiple integrated data sources.",Condition-Based Maintenance; Diagnostics; Prognostics,"['Data marketplaces, Data pricing, Data quality, Knapsack']",en

23714553,Performing Research Validity: A “Mangle of Practice” Approach,"Mainstream discussions of research validity (truth, significance, objectivity) draw heavily on a certain &ldquo;representational idiom&rdquo; of science [1] that assumes a knowledge&ndash;reality correspondence. However, for research on practices, rather than nature, such a knowledge-reality distinction is neither feasible nor desirable, as it is at odds with the very notion of a &ldquo;practice&rdquo;. Drawing on Pickering's alternative &ldquo;performative idiom&rdquo; for science, and extending it to participatory forms of social research, we propose alternative validity claims for practice-oriented research. Using the example of information infrastructuring practices, we show that the three aspects of validity thus reinterpreted become quite closely related to each other and also to the process of information infrastructuring itself.

23714719,Medication infrastructure development in Germany,"In principle, the advantages of the digital transformation of the German healthcare system have been recognized by stakeholders and policy-makers. The need to move forward has been emphasized by governmental and representative bodies. Funding has been allocated to finance pilot projects and infrastructure development. The electronic health card has been and continues to be the flagship of Ger-man ehealth initiatives. Its vision is nothing less than to replace most of the manual, paper-based communication processes by secure, digital pathways. Thereby, the initiative aims for providing a nationwide infrastructure on which in the future numerous applications can be build. It is essentially conceived as the entry ticket into the German healthcare system for every health insurance benefi-ciary. Yet, so far, the development of the ehealth card in Germany is characterized by delays and significant reductions in the functional scope compared to the original plans. For instance, electronic prescriptions are not any more considered as a priority application. While the government pushes the project further, it re-mains uncertain when and in what form the first applications will materialize. Some argue that the &ldquo;project's sheer size, scale and complexity&rdquo; is a major cause for its current state (Drews {&amp;} Schirmer, 2015 p.12). An iterative approach combined with a more balanced economic distribution of costs and benefits is suggested as a more promising way (ibid.) While we do not deny that such argu-ments are worth to consider, we would like to suggest the notion of &ldquo;installed base of opposition&rdquo; in order to make sense of the difficulties plaguing German ehealth initiatives. We have developed and used this concept to trace the devel-opment of a rather focused, albeit scalable ehealth project over the last 10 years. The clear focus of the initiative on medication management for polypharmacy patients not only implies significantly fewer stakeholders (patients, doctors, nursing homes, pharmacies) but also allows for a tangible definition of economic benefits as well as improvements to quality of care. The initiative aims to im-prove medication compliance for polypharmacy patients by providing patient specific medication packs functioning as dose administration aids, called auto-mated drug (or dose) dispensing (ADD). The involved work process is not entire-ly new but close to the existing practice of blistering pharmacies or blister cen-tres. Especially nursing or care homes and polypharmacy home care patients have been targeted as customers. The initiative aims to automate and informate this process to achieve economies of scale and to reduce errors due to manual blistering. Ideally, the weekly production of individualized medication packs would be built on key components of a general information infrastructure such as e-prescriptions, consolidated medication plans, and electronic communication be-tween doctors, pharmacists, ADD operators and health insurance providers in or-der to be able to operate most efficiently. Thus, ADD would benefit from and nicely tie into an existing information infrastructure like the one envisioned by the electronic health card, but it may very well function without such a basis. In this chapter we will show that this well-focused initiative suffered the same fate as the wider electronic prescription in Germany: It does not feature anymore in the discourse of ehealth applications. In our analysis, we were struck by the lack of an open and substantive discourse among the involved stakeholders. Giv-en the cooperatist and consensus oriented governance of the German health care system, a resistance that ranges from a lack of open discourse to outright block-ade is disturbing. Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the slow and cum-bersome progress of infrastructure development in the German healthcare sector can be explained by the existence of an installed base of opposition. This inter-pretation does not bode well for the latest attempt by the government to jumpstart the digital transformation of the German health care sector.","['e-prescription', 'health care', 'information systems design', 'inter-organizational information systems', 'national European information infrastructures', 'public patient- oriented web platforms', 'Open Access']","['Network governance', ' information management', ' humanitarian relief', ' boundary spanning']",en
23714803,Primary prevention for Employees in the Information Age Organization,"The nature of work and the way it is organized continues to change profoundly. The continuing debate on flexible work arrangements reveals the perceived need of policy makers to react to these changes in a balanced manner. Despite the demand of organizations and employees alike, the negative implications of flexible work arrangements threaten to counteract the equally valid arguments for their benefits. The new autonomy of the individual employee is mirrored by a management style that emphasizes results rather than specifying the way to achieve them. Despite the cherished liberties of the new workplace, studies indicate that stress due to unhealthy work practices has become a major concern for preventive care in these environments. Based on a study with IT professionals we set out to dispute the effectiveness of mainstream measures of preventive care that aim at (re-)regulating work. Instead, we propose an employee-centred approach to preventive care that aims at sensitizing employees to structural defects of new ways of working (through biofeedback and reflection on work patterns) and helping employees in crafting their work practices. Initial results of our empirical study, which combines biometric as well as qualitative data, indicate both the need and the potential for employee-centred preventive care. We demonstrate how bio feedback can inform the coaching of individuals in their quest for sustainable work practices.",available online at www; com; elsevier; hlpt; journal homepage; locate; lth policy and technology; primary prevention for employees; sciencedirect; www,,en

While device fragmentation-multiple, only partly compatible versions of a platform-has been complicating matters already, the need to target different device classes is a new emergence. Smartphones and tablets are relatively similar but app-enabled devices such as TVs and even cars typically have differing capabilities. To facilitate usage of cross-platform app development approaches, we present work on an evaluation framework. Our framework provides a set of up-todate evaluation criteria. Unlike prior work on this topic, it offers weighted assessment to cater for varieties in targeted device classes. Besides motivating and explaining the evaluation criteria, we present an exemplary application for one development approach and, as benchmarks, for native apps and Webapps. Our findings suggest that the proliferation of appenabled devices amplifies the need for improved development support.",App; Crossplatform; Evaluation; Mobile application; Mobile computing; Multi-platform,,en

23719034,Data Parallel Algorithmic Skeletons with Accelerator Support,"Hardware accelerators such as GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi comprise hundreds or thousands of cores on a single chip and promise to deliver high performance. They are widely used to boost the performance of highly parallel applications. However, because of their diverging architectures programmers are facing diverging programming paradigms. Programmers also have to deal with low-level concepts of parallel programming that make it a cumbersome task. In order to assist programmers in developing parallel applications Algorithmic Skeletons have been proposed. They encapsulate well-defined, frequently recurring parallel programming patterns, thereby shielding programmers from low-level aspects of parallel programming. The main contribution of this paper is a comparison of two skeleton library implementations, one in C++ and one in Java, in terms of library design and programmability. Besides, on the basis of four benchmark applications we evaluate the performance of the presented implementations on two test systems, a GPU cluster and a Xeon Phi system. The two implementations achieve comparable performance with a slight advantage for the C++ implementation. Xeon Phi performance ranges between CPU and GPU performance.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'GPGPU', 'Hardware accelerators', 'High-level parallel programming']","['Disaster management', ' social media analysis', ' human-is-the-loop', ' content moderation', ' supervised machine learning', ' humanitarian logistics']",en

23721481,"Towards an Information System for Evidence-based Analysis of Charging Behavior, Charging Demand, and Battery Degradation of Electric Vehicles","Batteries in Electric Vehicles (EV) are subject to a degradation process that has many, yet not fully understood, influential factors. Typically, the battery is continuously monitored by a proprietary Battery Management System (BMS) which records and analyzes various key figures of the battery. Because the BMS is proprietary, the data collected throughout the lifetime of an EV and its battery cannot simply be looked into by the owner but only by the EV manufacturer and licensed service providers. Hence, the EV owner is dependent on the manufacturer to retrieve accurate data regarding the State of Health (SOH) of the battery, e.g. when selling the vehicle or when the battery needs replacement. An in-depth understanding of charging behavior and the degradation process of an EV's battery requires a vast amount of data, which is a crucial factor limiting current research. This paper proposes an information system that blends into the EV charging infrastructure and utilizes a crowdsourcing approach to collect charging transaction data. In order to identify concealed dependencies with regards to battery degradation and to identify patterns in the charging behavior, an enrichment of the raw transaction data is motivated and different information providers are discussed. This augmentation integrates environmental information from various sources such as weather and location data. On a macroscopic view, analyses could point out the correlation between weather, public events, location, and charging demand. On an individual basis, the effect of environmental impacts, charging behavior, and driving profile on battery degradation can be investigated and compared.","['analytics', 'battery degradation', 'crowdsourced data', 'Electric mobility', 'EV charging behavior', 'EV charging demand']",,en

We first discuss the basic variants of the method that use gradient information and describe subsequently modifications that allow for a gradient free realization. Finally, we show that &lambda;-DS can be used to understand the behavior of stochastic local search within PMOPs to a certain extent which might be interesting for the development of future local search engines, or evolutionary strategies, for the treatment of such problems.

23771137,Similarity of Activities in Process Models: Towards a Metric for Domain-Specific Business Process Modeling Languages,"In the course of business process management, processes can be represented by models in order to document, analyze and improve processes. Many analyses of business process models require the calculation of similarity values between activities of different process models. Process models can be created using domain-specific business process modeling languages. These languages provide predefined domain-specific sets of activities and their properties and allow the annotation of property values based on glossaries. Since this information describes activities in detail, it enables a precise calculation of similarities between process model activities. However, the literature does not provide a suitable similarity calculation for two activities in different process models created with the same domain-specific process modeling language. Consequently, relying on design science research the contribution of this paper is to propose such a similarity metric. The metric incorporates annotated property values of activities and considers the properties' different relevance, takes into account the characteristics of quantitative properties and analyzes the contexts of activities. The metric is conceptualized and demonstrated by an example. Future research requires its technical implementation and evaluation.","['Process management', 'Process model matching', 'Process model similarity', 'Similarity measure', 'Similarity metric']","['Multiobjective optimization', ' Multimodality', ' Landscape analysis', ' Hypervolume gradient ascent', ' Set based optimization']",en
23771214,Semi-Automatic Inductive Derivation of Reference Process Models that Represent Best Practices in Public Administrations,"In the course of business process management, reference models are widely used for process improvement or as starting point for the creation of individual process models. Current scientific literature mainly offers deductive approaches to construct reference models. Although there are some approaches that inductively develop a reference model from a set of individual process models, these approaches focus on the derivation and representation of common practices. However, there is no inductive method to detect best practices and represent them in a reference model. This paper addresses this research gap by applying design science research to develop an approach for the semi-automatic and inductive derivation of reference process models that represent best practices in public administrations. The approach creates a merged model to keep the structure of the source models and detect identical parts in the process models. It identifies best practices using query constructs and ranking criteria to group process model elements and evaluate these groups. The contribution of this paper is a conceptualization of the approach and a demonstration of its functionality with an example. The implementation and evaluation is subject of future work.","['Benchmarking', 'E-Government', 'Process management', 'Process model merging', 'Reference modeling']",,en

This has led to the development of data marketplaces which facilitate trading by bringing data vendors and data consumers together on one platform. Despite the existence of such infrastructures, data vendors struggle to determine the value their offerings have to customers. This paper explores a novel pricing scheme that allows for price discrimination of customers by selling custom-tailored variants of a data product at a price suggested by a customer. To this end, data quality is adjusted to meet a customer’s willingness to pay. To balance customer preferences and vendor interest, a model is developed, translating fair pricing into a Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem and making it amenable to an algorithmic solution.","['Data marketplaces', 'Data pricing', 'Data quality', 'Knapsack']","['adoption', ' global', ' life cycle', ' network effects', ' social media']",en

23797635,ASlib: A Benchmark Library for Algorithm Selection,"The task of algorithm selection involves choosing an algorithm from a set of algorithms on a per-instance basis in order to exploit the varying performance of algorithms over a set of instances. The algorithm selection problem is attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in AI. Years of fruitful applications in a number of domains have resulted in a large amount of data, but the community lacks a standard format or repository for this data. This situation makes it difficult to share and compare different approaches effectively, as is done in other, more established fields. It also unnecessarily hinders new researchers who want to work in this area. To address this problem, we introduce a standardized format for representing algorithm selection scenarios and a repository that contains a growing number of data sets from the literature. Our format has been designed to be able to express a wide variety of different scenarios. To demonstrate the breadth and power of our platform, we describe a study that builds and evaluates algorithm selection models through a common interface. The results display the potential of algorithm selection to achieve significant performance improvements across a broad range of problems and algorithms.","['Algorithm selection', 'Empirical performance estimation', 'Machine learning']","['Averaged hausdorff distance, Convex front, Multi-objective optimization, Optimal archives']",en

Coordination of humanitarian actors when they are deployed to sites of crises greatly depends on the flow of information regarding their operations, and the use of online media and information systems has had an impact on their speed and effectiveness. In recent years formal humanitarian organizations have experimented working with virtual and technical communities (V&amp;TCs) in an effort to create robust humanitarian data and information products like crisis mapping techniques that augment coordination of physical responses in the field.

Ahuge share of these costs is caused by the electric vehiclebattery. Since the batteries' performance degrades over useand time, replacements become necessary to restore thevehicle's driving range, acceleration, and charging speed.Despite the degradation, repurposing used batteries for afurther use in less demanding second-life application scenariosseems feasible and desirable. However, neither a market norbusiness models for further using electric vehicle batteriesexist, yet. In this paper, we set out to review existing businessmodels for residential battery energy storage systems andsuggest a re-design to open up a market for storage systemsthat build on used electric vehicle batteries. The re-design isinformed by lemon-market theory. To mitigate market failurecaused by asymmetric information, the re-designed businessmodel strongly bases on offering value-added services.

Thus, it is crucial to study and analyze botnets, to take them down. For this, an extensive monitoring is a pre-requisite for preparing a botnet takedown, e.g., via a sinkholing attack. However, every new monitoring mechanism developed for botnets is usually tackled by the botmasters by introducing novel antimonitoring countermeasures. In this paper, we anticipate these countermeasures by proposing a set of lightweight techniques for detecting the presence of crawlers in P2P botnets, called BoobyTrap. For that, we exploit botnet-specific protocol and design constraints. We evaluate the performance of our BoobyTrap mechanism on two real-world botnets: Sality and ZeroAccess. Our results indicate that we can distinguish many crawlers from benign bots. In fact, we discovered close to 10 crawler nodes within our observation period in the Sality botnet and around 120 in the ZeroAccess botnet. In addition, we also describe the observable characteristics of the detected crawlers and suggest crawler improvements for enabling monitoring in the presence of the BoobyTrap mechanism.",,,en

It forms a complex good that propels the vehicle's engine and causes around 25% of the vehicle's overall costs. Unfortunately, due to deterioration, the battery's use gradually restricts a vehicle's driving range, acceleration, and charging speed over time. Consequently, after about eight to ten years of operation or at least about 120,000 kilometers driven, automobile manufacturers recommend a battery replacement. Despite its deterioration, the battery might still be repurposed to serve as a battery energy storage system in less demanding second-life application scenarios. Examples are home energy storage solutions for storing energy from photovoltaic panels or larger buffer storage solutions for stabilizing energy from wind parks or solar farms. With strongly increasing numbers of electric vehicles world-wide, some hundred thousand aged batteries can be assumed to be available per year in the 2020s. Additionally, considering the necessity for a reliable matching of individually aged batteries and second-life application scenarios, the decision for which scenario a battery should be repurposed needs to be supported by information systems. However, since current research falls short of identifying and prioritizing the requirements that characterize second-life application scenarios, information system developers lack justificatory knowledge to guide and constrain the design of corresponding information systems. In an explorative multi-method study, we set out to identify the requirement categories and metrics that need to be elicited for repurposing batteries. We triangulate evidence from a Delphi Study involving 20 battery experts with field data on the EfficiencyHouse Plus, a revelatory proof-of-concept project on repurposing and further using batteries as battery energy storage system in a smart home context. The study (a) contributes a prioritized list of requirement categories and metrics for repurposing batteries, and (b) documents how they were instantiated respectively why they were important in the analyzed case.

23847095,From Legislation to Potential Compliance Violations in Business Processes - Simplicity Matters,"The compliance of businesses is a highly relevant topic for companies of all sectors. Compliance comprises all necessities for obeying legal regulations as well as mandatory norms, and violations can entail painful penalties. Since nearly all companies base their daily business on the execution of business processes (consciously or unconsciously), these business processes also have to be compliant. Hence, as part of business process management, business process compliance becomes increasingly important for companies. However, the checking of business processes for their compliance is - against the backdrop of many existing business processes and incessantly changing regulations - not an easy task. Several research approaches have been developed for supporting compliance checking. A common way is to examine the models of the business processes automatically to detect compliance violations with predefined patterns that represent possible violations. Unfortunately, only the fewest approaches are actually applied by companies due to high technical restrictions or difficult handling. The presented graph-theoretic approach strives to overcome this with a high level of simplicity and the applicability to real-world process models. For that, a real legislative passage is gradually transformed into an automatically searchable compliance pattern and applied to real process models.",Business Process Compliance; Compliance Patterns; Business Process Modeling; Simplicity,,en

The studies show that, while organizations require a diverse set of BPM-related competencies, employees report far fewer competencies in their public profiles. In particular, social and problem-solving competencies are underrepresented on the supply side. Perhaps the BPM workforce as a whole lacks such competencies, or employees consider them not worth declaring. Understanding of the demanded competencies and the gaps between them and the supplied competencies is of value for BPM educators who wish to help improve BPM curricula and for future BPM professionals who seek to enter and eventually advance in the BPM field.",,"['Big data, Organizations, Data models, Object recognition, Analytical models, Technological innovation, Big Data, business data processing, organisational aspects, supply chain management, organization, business-driven ideation, data-driven ideation, enterprise architecture management-based implementation, Big Data idea generation, IT value theory, workgroup ideation, idea assessment, implementation management, business model generation techniques, supply chain management, Big Data, Big Data Introduction Methodology, Enterprise Architecture Management, Business Model Canvas']",en

23870005,Refining a Reference Architecture for Model-Driven Business Apps,"Despite much progress, cross-platform app development frameworks remain a topic of active research. While frameworks that yield native apps are particularly attractive, their spread is very limited. It is apparent that (theoretical) technological superiority needs to be accompanied with profound support for developers and adequate capabilities for maintaining the framework itself. We deem so called reference architectures to be a major step for building better cross-platform app development frameworks, particularly if they are based on techniques of model-driven software development (MDSD). In this paper, we describe a refinement of a reference architecture for business apps. We employ the model-driven cross-platform development framework MD2 for this purpose. Its general design has been described extensively in the literature. The framework has a sound foundation in MDSD, yet lacks a generator support that fulfils the above sketched goals. After describing the required background, we argue in detail for a suitable reference architecture. While it will be a valuable addition to the MD2 framework, the discussion of our findings also makes a contribution for generative app development in general.",Reference Architecture; MDSD; App; Mobile; Mobile App; Business App; Architecture,"['Supply Chain Flexibility', ' Flexibility Measurement']",en
23873696,Smart workplace technology buzz,"During the last decade, technology at the workplace has changed. Realtime communication and collaboration capabilities such as video, instant messaging, presence management, and web sharing have been added to the workplace ecosystem as enterprises have started to introduce social media systems to shape a new way of knowledge management and employee communication and connectivity. Though the introduction of such workplace technology has often been driven from an executive level as part of a vision and optimization initiative with high expectations, adoption among the user community is varying from excitement to denial. The mentioned areas of technology are part of an open infrastructure, and in contrast to business applications (e.g., SAP), there is no dedicated business process guiding the adoption. The adoption is infl uenced both by technical features and the specifi c culture of the enterprise. Trust within teams and management actions has, among other factors, a strong impact on the outcome. Therefore, a multidimensional view on technology and organizational aspects, both on a group and an individual level, is needed to guide enterprises through the journey to a digital workplace. Within this chapter, we will present a framework capturing the various dimensions and discuss the application along a specifi c case. We will also suggest how to approach complex rollouts of workplace technology with a focus on real-time communication and collaboration in an enterprise and how a framework can support a structured way of implementation and community development fostering adoption.",Case study; Digital workplace; Interdependence of technology and organizational change; Social collaboration technology,"['App, Architecture, MDSD, Mobile, Reference architecture']",en

Since sustainable actions can only result from a pluralistic decision-making process, researchers agree that decision support systems (DSSs) in particular are important for green IS research. Because this research field has grown during the last decade, we set out to identify the contribution of DSS research conducted in green IS research. We conducted a structured literature review to reveal currently available DSSs contributions, their structure, and impact. The applied literature search and selection process identified 23 papers to be relevant to the review. A concept-centric literature analysis revealed that many DSS contributions conduct design research and demonstrate the addressed research problems' feasibility by implemented DSS prototypes. However, the literature review identifies a lack of subscription to green IS research. Despite numerous ""green"" DSSs are available in the literature, their subscription to the field of green IS research is missing. Finally, a research agenda is conceptualized for systematizing future DSS research in the domain of green IS research. Further research should increase the number of contributions conducting design-oriented research that should mainly result in software implementations to demonstrate the solutions' feasibility and ""green"" utility.",Structured Literature Review; Organizing Framework; Green IS Research; Decision Support Systems; Research Agenda,"['Parallel programming', ' algorithmic skeletons', ' farm']",en
23888039,On the Closest Averaged Hausdorff Archive for a Circularly Convex Pareto Front,"The averaged Hausdorff distance has been proposed as an indicator for assessing the quality of finitely sized approximations of the Pareto front of a multiobjective problem. Since many set-based, iterative optimization algorithms store their currently best approximation in an internal archive these approximations are also termed archives. In case of two objectives and continuous variables it is known that the best approximations in terms of averaged Hausdorff distance are subsets of the Pareto front if it is concave. If it is linear or circularly concave the points of the best approximation are equally spaced. Here, it is proven that the optimal averaged Hausdorff approximation and the Pareto front have an empty intersection if the Pareto front is circularly convex. But the points of the best approximation are equally spaced and they rapidly approach the Pareto front for increasing size of the approximation.","['Averaged hausdorff distance', 'Convex front', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Optimal archives']",,en

For the LS in two out of the three regions we will utilize and adapt the Directed Search method which allows to steer the search into any direction given in objective space and which is thus well suited for the problem at hand. We further on integrate the resulting LS mechanism into SMS-EMOA, a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm for hypervolume approximations. Finally, we will present some numerical results on several benchmark problems with two and three objectives indicating the strength and competitiveness of the novel hybrid.","['Multi-objective optimization', 'Evolutionary computation', 'Memetic algorithm', 'Directed search method', 'Hypervolume']","['Challenges, Humanitarian logistics, Logistics service providers, Relief organizations, Survey']",en
23888207,MO-ParamILS: A Multi-objective Automatic Algorithm Configuration Framework,"Automated algorithm configuration procedures play an increasingly important role in the development and application of algorithms for a wide range of computationally challenging problems.  Until very recently, these configuration procedures were limited to optimising a single performance objective, such as the running time or solution quality achieved by the algorithm being configured.  However, in many applications there is more than one performance objective of interest.  This gives rise to the multi-objective automatic algorithm configuration problem, which involves finding a Pareto set of configurations of a given target algorithm that characterises trade-offs between multiple performance objectives.  In this work, we introduce MO-ParamILS, a multi-objective extension of the state-of-the-art single-objective algorithm configuration framework ParamILS, and demonstrate that it produces good results on several challenging bi-objective algorithm configuration scenarios compared to a base-line obtained from using a state-of-the-art single-objective algorithm configurator.","Algorithm Configuration, Parameter tuning, Multi-objective optimisation, Local search algorithms",,en

However, the reasons for their success are not yet fully understood. Recent approaches take an analytical viewpoint and try to identify instance features, which make an instance hard or easy to solve. We contribute to this area by generating instance sets for couples of TSP algorithms A and B by maximizing/minimizing their performance difference in order to generate instances which are easier to solve for one solver and much harder to solve for the other. This instance set offers the potential to identify key features which allow to distinguish between the problem hardness classes of both algorithms.","['Algorithm selection', 'Feature selection', 'Instance hardness', 'TSP']",,en

Nearly all life areas are affected by the widespread availability and ever growing use of the Internet. In the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in how to best implement the benefits of new technologies within public administrations - not only to reform the work of administrations, but also to provide their stakeholders with public services in a way that fits their demands. But compared to other electronic services like ecommerce public administrations are still confronted with low adoption rates, notably on the part of citizens. We conducted a literature review to identify possible barriers to citizens' adoption of electronic government services and gathered data from 197 journals that published articles on the nonadoption or rejection of electronic government services. Although the results are quite heterogeneous, our findings reveal six superordinate categories of barriers: technological, socioeconomic, communication, cultural, individual and service-related barriers. Moreover, this review reveals considerable gaps in the research on electronic government rejection. Finally, we can show that there is no common ground on barriers to adoption. Thus, we provide an agenda that encourages further research concerning the interaction between citizens and public administrations via electronic channels.",e-government; technology adoption; literature review,,en
23900306,ASlib: A Benchmark Library for Algorithm Selection,"The task of algorithm selection involves choosing an algorithm from a set of algorithms on a per-instance basis in order to exploit the varying performance of algorithms over a set of instances. The algorithm selection problem is attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in AI. Years of fruitful applications in a number of domains have resulted in a large amount of data, but the community lacks a standard format or repository for this data. This situation makes it difficult to share and compare different approaches effectively, as is done in other, more established fields. It also unnecessarily hinders new researchers who want to work in this area. To address this problem, we introduce a standardized format for representing algorithm selection scenarios and a repository that contains a growing number of data sets from the literature. Our format has been designed to be able to express a wide variety of different scenarios. To demonstrate the breadth and power of our platform, we describe a study that builds and evaluates algorithm selection models through a common interface. The results display the potential of algorithm selection to achieve significant performance improvements across a broad range of problems and algorithms.","['Algorithm selection', 'Empirical performance estimation', 'Machine learning']",,en
23900465,Low-Budget Exploratory Landscape Analysis on Multiple Peaks Models,"When selecting the best suited algorithm for an unknown optimization problem, it is useful to possess some a priori knowledge of the problem at hand. In the context of single-objective, continuous optimization problems such knowledge can be retrieved by means of Exploratory Landscape Analy\-sis (ELA), which automatically identifies properties of a landscape, e.g., the so-called funnel structures, based on an initial sample. In this paper, we extract the relevant features (for detecting funnels) out of a large set of landscape features when only given a small initial sample consisting of 50*D observations, where $D$ is the number of decision space dimensions. This is already in the range of the start population sizes of many evolutionary algorithms. The new Multiple Peaks Model Generator (MPM2) is used for training the classifier, and the approach is then very successfully validated on the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) and a subset of the CEC 2013 niching competition problems.","['Empirical study', 'Fitness landscapes', 'Machine learning', 'Multiple solutions/Niching', 'Working principles of evolutionary computing']","['single source', ' hospital information system', ' clinical study', ' patient', ' recruitment', ' routine data']",en

However, this business knowledge is an essential intellectual property, and thus needs protection from misuse. In this paper, we present an analysis of knowledge difficult to protect. We enact a strategy to achieve SDPs success despite these barriers. Our theoretical and empirical analysis also found that SDP success is largely an uncertainty problem between the contractual parties on the management level, and thus technical-organizational approaches alone are inadequate for achieving success. Based on property rights theory, we introduce two models for protecting knowledge depending on uncertainties. Our findings offer managers important insights how they can design and enact especially fixed-price contracts. Moreover, we show how the economic theories can enhance understanding of SDP dynamics and advance the development of a theory of effective control of SDP success.",Software development project; Information Knowledge; Intellectual property rights; Property rights theory,,en

24111528,Mobile vs Desktop Online Consumer Search Behaviour,"Relevance &amp; Research Question: Extant literature suggest that mobile devices change the way consumers use search engines (Church et al. 2008). Kamwar and Baluja (2006) and Kamwar et al. (2009) found that mobile users tend to do fewer search queries on mobile devices (1.6 per session) compared to desktops (&gt;2). However, Kamwar and Baluja (2006, p. 27) conjecture that mobile &ldquo;breadth and depth of information desire&rdquo; will increase. Literature also suggests the socio-demographic characteristics, such as age or income, have an influence on consumer behaviour (Hernandez et al. 2011). We want to investigate the differences of search behaviour using mobile devices compared to desktop computers based on average website visits per month. We operationalise search breadth and depth in terms of consideration set (CS) (Howard 1977) and time (Hoyer 1984, Ratchford et al. 2003). Therefore, our research question are: 1a) Are there differences between mobile and desktop search behaviour? 1b) If yes, what are the differences? 2) What is the moderating effect of age or income on the mobile and desktop search behaviour?Methods &amp; Data: Our study is based on ComScore clickstream data. We compare the behaviour across three subsets of users (mobile only, desktop only, both) aggregated at the level of a month. We take consideration set, total time, frequency, and time per visit as metrics of search behaviour.Results: Our initial findings based on US market data suggest clear variations across our four metrics for the different subsets of users. Time spent on search is lower for mobile users than for desktop users. Age and income variables have a moderating effect on search breadth and depth. Similarly, our initial results do not support the assumption of Kamwar and Baluja (2006).Added Value: The results of this study highlight the impact of devices used on the search behaviour. Previous findings, which have been mainly based on log-file analysis and suggest that mobile searchers show similar search patterns to web searchers (Church et al. 2008) are not supported by our findings. The initial findings promise to have practical implications for marketing.",,"['Communities, E-learning 2.0, Web 2.0']",en
24122028,The Role of Gender in Business Process Management Competence Supply,"While Business Process Management (BPM) was originally focused on Information Technology as a key factor driving the efficiency and effectiveness of organizational processes, there is now a growing consensus among practitioners and academics that BPM represents a holistic management approach that also takes such factors as corporate governance, human capital, and organizational culture into account. Studies show that the BPM practice faces a shortage of competence supply that stems from a shortage of qualified BPM professionals. At the same time, there is a distinct underrepresentation of women in technology-related fields; it has been suggested that gender stereotypes are one of the reasons for this underrepresentation. The goal of this research paper is, thus, to better understand the role of gender in the BPM competences supply. In this study 10,405 LinkedIn profiles of BPM professionals were analyzed using a text mining technique called Latent Semantic Analysis. Twelve distinct categories of supplied BPM competences were identified and it was investigated how far gender biases exist among BPM professionals. The nature of BPM-related competences is discussed, together with the differences in their presentation by male and female professionals, which indicate potential existence of gender stereotypes. Further, it is discussed how the apparent underrepresentation of women among BPM professionals can be addressed to close the competence gap in the field. The study contributes to both the call for research on human capital in the BPM field, and the calls for research on gender and gender stereotypes in technology-related fields.",Business process management; Competences Skills; Latent semantic analysis; Text mining; Gender diversity; BPM workforce,,en

Covenants expand the set of financial instruments expressible in Bitcoin, and enable new powerful and novel use cases. We illustrate two novel security constructs built using covenants. The first, vaults, focuses on improving the security of private cryptographic keys. Historically, maintaining these keys securely and reliably has been a critical vulnerability for Bitcoin users.We show how covenants enable vaults, which disincentivize key theft by preventing an attacker from gaining full access to stolen funds. The second construct, poison transactions, is a generally useful mechanism for penalizing double-spending attacks. Bitcoin-NG, a protocol that has been recently proposed to improve Bitcoin’s throughput, latency and overall scalability, requires this feature. We show how covenants enable poison transactions, and detail how Bitcoin-NG can be implemented progressively as an overlay on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.",,"['Web 2.0', ' User-generated content', ' Legal issues', ' Regulation']",en

framework for supply chain flexibility
","Today&rsquo;s supply chains (SC) are acting in an ever more complex, dynamic and uncertain business environment. Increased customer expectations regarding product variety, shortened product life-cycles and volatile demand motivate the need for supply chain flexibility (SCF) in the face of stiff competition and environmental changes. Flexibility processes implementation in supply chains varies according to companies and SC, due to several factors. The level of awareness of the need for flexibility, the proactive or reactive plan and use of flexibility; and the focus on the SC as a whole or in single companies are examples. The concept of process maturity assumes that the implementation of procedures is carried out in multiple evolutionary and successive stages, which are explicitly defined, managed and measured. Maturity models give companies indicators as well as guidance to analyze and subsequently improve their processes. Despite several SC maturity models in the literature, there is not a model focusing on the maturity of SC flexibility processes, like the one intended in this paper. The levels of the maturity of SCF are (1) none, (2) inter-firm, (3) SC reactive, (4) SC proactive, and (5) SC paradigmatic. Each level has five dimensions: (1) Collaboration, (2) Information Technology, (3) Information flow, (4) Internal flexibility types and (5) Performance measurement. A toy case drawn from the automotive industry illustrates the application of the model from a dyad perspective. Based on the findings, SC flexibility maturity levels are measured in each of the analyzed links and areas for improvement are identified.",Supply Chain Flexibility; Flexibility Measurement,,en
24255211,Towards a Reference Architecture for Model-Driven Business Apps,"Model-driven development techniques have been proposed for cross-platform app development. Typically, an individual domain-specific language (DSL) is used. The MD framework consists of a DSL for business apps and generators, which transform a domain model to native platform code. Prior research on it focused on language and general generator design, this paper accentuates the code generation stage. A reference architecture for the generated apps is proposed to accelerate the development of new generators for which architectural decisions had been made on ad-hoc basis up to now. Moreover, generators are going to expose similar structures that facilitate maintenance. Our proposal takes MD's characteristics into account while providing developers with greater flexibility.

24258199,They Not Only Live Once – Towards Product-Service Systems for Repurposed Electric Vehicle Batteries,"Today, two central issues interfere with a widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs): a limited convenience in terms of range and refueling as well as high costs. The expensive battery technology causes the better part of these costs. However, after about 8 to 10 years of operation and 120.000 driven kilometers, battery degradation leads to a reduced range and decreased acceleration. The battery should then be replaced. Repurposing and further using these batteries in less demanding applications forms a new source of income and might lower the costs of EVs. Despite suggestions for second life applications, the establishment of mature business models is still a long way off. One cause lies in the customers' uncertainty concerning the quality of repurposed electric vehicle batteries (EVBs). In this work, we suggest the design of product-service systems (PSS) to counter this uncertainty. We perform a literature review to identify central activities, actors, as well as challenges that shape an EVB's life cycle. Focusing on challenges that affect the customers' perception of an EVB's quality, we suggest examples for services and further PSS building blocks to address these challenges.",Electric Vehicle Batteries; Repurposing; Second Life; Product-Service Systems; EOL-IS,,en

24372951,Web-oriented Architectures: On the Impact of Web 2.0 on Service-oriented Architectures,"Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) have been discussed intensively in science and industry since their first appearance in the mid-nineties. However, even today there is no generally accepted method for modeling a SOA or for converting other concepts (e.g., monolithic architectures, CORBA landscapes) into a SOA. There are numerous standards available in the SOA context, but instead of easing the creation of a SOA, they typically make their realization more complicated. On the other hand, recent developments in the Web 2.0 context show how easy it can be to link or compose (""mesh"") IT components dynamically, so that original SOA goals like flexibility or reduction of complexity can be achieved by relatively simple means. An interesting concept in this context is the Web-oriented architecture (WOA), which represents a specialization of SOAs obtained by using simple Web 2.0 technologies and standards.

24373107,Towards Web 2.0 Driven Learning Environments,"Over the last decade, it has been widely argued that technology-enhanced learning could respond to the needs of the new knowledge society and transform the way we learn. However, despite isolated achievements, technology-enhanced learning has not really succeeded yet in revolutionizing our education and learning processes. In fact, most current initiatives do not focus on the social aspect of learning and learning content is still pushed to a pre-defined group of learners in closed environments. Recently, Web 2.0 concepts have started to open new doors for more effective learning and have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of traditional learning models. In this paper we show in which way the community-driven platform Learnr, under development at the University of Münster, puts crucial success factors for future technology enhanced learning into practice, applying well known concepts like networking and social tagging. As a consequence, a Web 2.0 perspective on learners, learning content and learning communities can be derived.","['Communities', 'E-learning 2.0', 'Web 2.0']",,en

The main idea is to simulate a chemical reaction on multisets, also called bags. Some elements of a bag which fulfil a certain predicate (also called reaction condition) may be taken from the multiset and replaced by new elements which are generated by combining the selected elements using the so-called reaction function. In the present paper, we investigate the efficient parallel implementation of the Gamma scheme. In particular, the reaction condition can be split into parts which are tested as early as possible. Possible atomic conditions are arithmetic comparisons. We use the properties of the arithmetic comparisons in order to restrict the range of bag elements which has to be considered. Reconsiderations of the same bag elements are avoided. Moreover, a sophisticated protocol is needed in order to avoid deadlocks when several processes compete for the same bag elements.

Here we consider the efficient implementation of lazy narrowing, a strategy which only evaluates the arguments of a function application, if their evaluation is really demanded. For an efficient implementation of lazy narrowing it is crucial to evaluate the arguments as early as possible. Otherwise the arguments are frequently reevaluated. A demandedness analysis is used to detect which parts of the arguments can safely be evaluated before the call to the function. Several approaches (e.g. [HLW92, JMM92]) also use this idea, but they sacrifice laziness in order to avoid ineIilciency. Our approach is more lazy than the previous approaches, and it uses a more powerful notion of demandedness, which allows to express infinite demand patterns like e.g. spine normal form. Moreover, in contrast to the previous approaches, we take into account dependencies between the arguments of a function in order to improve the efficiency.",,,en

Our approach is to support data parallelism by providing a set of primitives on arrays which allow the user to control the parallelism and communication on a high level, disabling problems like deadlocks. Only one unique version of an array may be referenced at a time. This restriction allows arrays to be updated in place and enables the user to control the space requirements of the program. The uniqueness of arrays is checked by the compiler. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our data parallel functional language.",,,en

41373216,A process-oriented modeling approach for graphical development of mobile business apps,"Mobile app development is an activity predominantly performed by software developers. Domain experts and future users are merely considered in early development phases as source of requirements or consulted for evaluating the resulting product. In the domain of business apps, many cross-platform programming frameworks exist but approaches also targeted at non-technical users are rare. Existing graphical notations for describing apps either lack the simplicity to be understandable by domain experts or are not expressive enough to support automated processing. The MAML framework is proposed as model-driven approach for describing mobile apps in a platform-agnostic fashion not only for software developers but also for process modelers and domain experts. Data, views, business logic, and user interactions are jointly modeled from a process perspective using a graphical domain-specific language. To aggregate multiple use cases and provide advanced modeling support, an inference mechanism is utilized to deduce a global data model. Through model transformations, native apps are then automatically generated for multiple platforms without manual programming. Our approach is compared to the IFML notation in an observational study, with promising results regarding readability and usability.","['Business app', 'Data model inference', 'Graphical DSL', 'Mobile application', 'Model-driven software development']",,en

41419151,Assessing the Perceived Value of Cloud-based Technologies in Natural Disasters: The Case of New Zealand Emergency Management,"In response to a lack of existing theory explaining the possible association between cloud-based technology (C-BT) deployment and emergency management, this paper explores the perceived value C-BT can provide within the emergency management sector, with a specific focus on natural events. The research utilised multiple data sources including semi-structured interviews, a focus group, and observations to achieve triangulated findings. The adoption of grounded theory analysis has resulted in the identification of key elements influencing the perception of C-BT deployment in natural events. Findings indicate that organizational readiness, coordination, individual perception, individual readiness, C-BT characteristics, and non C-BT redundancy constitute the key dimensional elements influencing the perceived C-BT usage in natural events. The findings serve as a knowledge base for emergency professionals in both New Zealand and other countries that are also coping with frequent natural disasters to enhance their organisational and individual readiness in C-BT usage in natural events, leading to more effective emergency management performance.","['cloud-based technology', 'preparedness', 'response', 'usage perception']",,en

41446085,Can we Learn from Down Under How to Rise Up in E-Government? A Comparative Analysis of the Public Sector Competences in the German and Australian Higher Education Systems,"Australia has been voted world&rsquo;s second in the last two United Nations e-government surveys 2014 and 2016, despite the acknowledged difficulties that arise in terms of implementation because of its federal structure. Germany, having a similar federal structure, in contrast, only ranks 15th. The study at hand aims at eliciting, if this development can be ascribed to the higher public administration and e-government education landscape. By means of a content analysis, we examined 126 higher education study programmes with a link to the public sector in Australia and compared them to a similar study in Germany from the year 2015. Results show that there are indeed differences with respect to the delivered contents and the respective competences in Australia that might contribute to the different e-government development in the two countries: Higher levels of socio-technical courses and a more contextualised programme delivery in general are two of the main findings.",Emerging Topics in Electronic Government; Australia; comparative Analysis; competences; higher education; Germany,"['Collaboration, Design Science, Knowledge Management, Research Communities, Research Portal']",en
41453016,A Classification Framework for Beacon Applications,"Beacons have received considerable attention in recent years, which is partially due to the fact that they serve as a flexible and versatile replacement for RFIDs in many applications. However, beacons are mostly considered from a purely technical perspective. This paper provides a conceptual view on application scenarios for beacons and introduces a novel framework for characterizing these. The framework consists of four dimensions: device movement, action trigger, purpose type, and connectivity requirements. Based on these, three archetypical scenarios are described. Finally, event-condition-action rules and online algorithms are used to formalize the backend of a beacon architecture.",Beacons; IoT; classification; indoor applications; navigation devices; location-based services; location-based technologies; wireless technologies,,en
41475868,Social Bots: Human-Like by Means of Human Control?,"Social bots are currently regarded an influential but also somewhat mysterious factor in public discourse and opinion making. They are considered to be capable of massively distributing propaganda in social and online media, and their application is even suspected to be partly responsible for recent election results. Astonishingly, the term social bot is not well defined and different scientific disciplines use divergent definitions. This work starts with a balanced definition attempt, before providing an overview of how social bots actually work (taking the example of Twitter) and what their current technical limitations are. Despite recent research progress in Deep Learning and Big Data, there are many activities bots cannot handle well. We then discuss how bot capabilities can be extended and controlled by integrating humans into the process and reason that this is currently the most promising way to realize meaningful interactions with other humans. This finally leads to the conclusion that hybridization is a challenge for current detection mechanisms and has to be handled with more sophisticated approaches to identify political propaganda distributed with social bots.",Social Bots; Big Data,,en
41476297,Cyber Risk Information Sharing with Authorities,"Cyber risk management largely reduces to a race for information between attackers and defenders of ICT systems. Defenders can gain advantage in this race by sharing cyber risk information with each other. Yet, defenders often exchange less information than is socially desirable, as their decisions are guided by selfish reasons. This can motivate regulators to enact laws mandating defenders' information exchange. In particular in Europe, many laws oblige defenders' information sharing with authorities, who in turn can advise others to strengthen the overall defense in the economy. This dissertation sheds first light into the economics of cyber risk information sharing with authorities.",Cyber risk management; information sharing; policy; game-theory,,en

New information system architectures like enterprise information portals provide a personalized single gateway to quantitative information, which is mainly provided by data warehouse and OLAP systems for analysis purposes, as well as to qualitative information, which can be administered by content management systems. As the engineering of enterprise information portals meeting managers&rsquo; special information needs is a complex process, there is a need for suitable approaches to support in particular the requirements definition.<br /> While graphical models like ER models, flow-chart-diagrams etc. are wide spread and accepted by executives as well as system developers for system requirements specification, an adequate modeling language for the domain of enterprise information portals is missing. This contribution proposes such a modeling language. Its specification is formalized in terms of a model: a meta-model.

In highly unstructured settings however, these techniques have to deal with in-complete data, which still is a demanding challenge. In order to address it, we propose an alternative ""dual"" interpretation of mining results and outline the theoretical basis upon which process mining techniques could be extended and modified to deliver such results.","['Business Process Mining', 'Incompleteness', 'Service-Orientation']",,en
4480907,"On the Ontological Expressiveness of Conceptual Modeling Grammars for Service
Productivity Management","Conceptualizing, analyzing, and optimizing service productivity is imperative to build up and to sustain competitive advantage in today&rsquo;s global service economy. However, service productivity is yet to be thoroughly conceptualized and supported by IT artifacts so as to design, compute, and interpret meaningful productivity models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ontological expressiveness of conceptual modeling grammars for service productivity management. Due to a lack of a complete ontology for service productivity management, we compile evaluation criteria by reviewing authoritative theory. Against these criteria, a selection of conceptual modeling grammars is analyzed by reviewing the grammars&rsquo; meta models for completeness. The analysis contributes two major insights. First, theory in productivity management appears equivocal and is too unspecific to guide the design of IT artifacts. Second, conceptual modeling grammars are subject to various ontological deficiencies with respect to service productivity management. Two core implications are identified. First, service productivity theories need to be refined as design theories in order to comprehensively inform the design of IT artifacts. Second, conceptual modeling grammars must be extended and aligned with each other.",Service Science Management and Engineering; Conceptual modeling grammar; Service productivity; Meta modeling; Ontology,"['Business process management, Creativity, Risk, Risk management']",en

Current research and business practice face the challenge of developing a wide range of different productivity models. These models were created simultaneously but isolated from each other. Thus several practices of productivity model construction have emerged. This paper presents a unifying modelling language that lists and interrelates the essential constructs pertinent to productivity models. Ultimately it was transferred into practice by employing a software tool. The application was conducted in the area of facility management, supporting two different approaches of productivity benchmarking. Facility management features a huge diversity of offered services and bundles. Thus, facility managers cope with various definitions of productivity that are then modelled with our approach.",Construction; Productivity Models; Service Science; Facility Management,,en

Several projects with established modelling and reorganisation approaches from the private sector show (Fraser et al. 2003; Seltsikas and Palkovits 2006), that the specific legal, personnel, and political conditions rule out a careless adoption of these approaches for the public sector. Especially, the high amount of public services requires an efficient representation of the entire process landscape in order to measure the overall reorganisation potential. Focusing on isolated processes only leads to small local improvements (Raster 1994). In this paper the PICTURE-approach for an integrated business process management in public administrations is presented. The PICTURE-method allows for an efficient documentation of the entire process landscape in a public administration and a detailed analysis of the resulting process descriptions.",Business Process Management; E-Government; Information Modelling; Process; Building Blocks; Public Administration; Process Landscape,"['Change management, ERP implementation, Governance theory, IT consulting']",en

4482637,Managing Creative Risks,"Business process management (BPM) has emerged as an important enabler for managing risks. Organizations use BPM techniques such as process modeling to create transparency and to identify process-related risks. Existent risk management frameworks distinguish between different types of risk, such as people, technical, and management risk. Our study suggests that creativity in business processes leads to a particular subset of risks which organizations respond to by applying specific strategies of risk avoidance and mitigation. These creative risks occur within business processes as different people come together to generate creative products. These people bring in different perceptions of creativity and aesthetics and solve creative tasks in different ways. Thus, business processes that involve creativity are characterized by a high variance both in process flow and process outcome which can lead to unwanted consequences. Based on interpretive case studies we introduce the concept of creative risk and explain what strategies organizations can apply to handle it.","['Business process management', 'Creativity', 'Risk', 'Risk management']",,

At the same time, the demographic change posed numerous challenges to the development of new strategies. The need for inclusive E-Government, as well as human resource issues and the general reorientation of services require substantial investments. However, depopulation leads to a reduction in tax income, resulting in an imbalance of public budget. Cooperation between municipalities can be a promising approach to reduce costs and thus deal with major challenges of demographic transition in both front office and back office.

Consequently, for the IS discipline there arise a couple of research questions in this context. The goal of this interpretive research is to develop a theory of creativity-intensive processes that can inform organizational design and the design of information systems. The central theme of this research is the awareness that creativity must be perceived as a part of business processes - that is, part of goal-oriented acting within an organization that comprises of both creative and non-creative activities. In this paper, we introduce an initial model of the creativity-intensive process based on a qualitative exploratory study. To do so, we introduce research method and concepts as well as relationships and interactions between concepts.

4483933,Confirming BPM Theory in Creative Industry Context - A Case Study in the German TV Industry,"Creativity is an important predecessor of any innovation. In the creative industries, innovation is part of the daily business. However, only little is known about the management of business processes that involve creativity. A pioneer contribution in the field of IS is the theory of managing creativity-intensive processes (TMCP) (Seidel 2009). It provides an analytical perspective for the understanding and management of this special kind of business processes. However the theory was developed in a very specific context - the movie post production. With our contribution, we focus on the confirmation and possibly extension of the theory's core concept of the creativity-intensive process (CIP) and its specifying properties. We conducted a multi-case study in the German TV industry guided by TMCP. The analyzed data resides from the context of the visual production process and the TV format (e.g. TV movie, quiz show, daily soap etc.) as its creative product. Our data supports the TMCP's core concept and its properties. Moreover we identified the ""degree of industrialization"" of CIPs as a new emergent property class. The property of the creative potential was refined to product related, as well as process related creativity and the creative impulse. We contribute to the qualitative empirical validation of TMCP and thus broaden its relevance as an analytical device for Business Process Management (BPM) in other creative contexts. Moreover a better understanding for the management challenges in the industry under research is provided.","['BPM', 'Case study', 'Creativity', 'Theory']",,en

4484205,A Method for Managing IT-Based Boundary Objects: Design and Application in the Public Sector,"To achieve high-quality services offerings, public administrations need to cooperate with other institutions across organizational boundaries. The required cooperation may lead to a complex network including several of the thousands public administrations, enterprises and citizens on the different federal layers of a single country. Key challenge for achieving smooth end-to-end processes in such setting is a proper management of information exchanges at the interfaces between networked actors, as it is the exchange of information that glues together separated chunks of a process. This article conceptualizes the digital information assets residing at the interfaces between the different actors as IT-based boundaries objects. It further reports on a design research process that was initiated by the German Federal Ministry of Interior, which felt the need for a nationwide management method for those IT-based boundary objects. The achieved method extends the BOMOS framework as developed by the Dutch government and adopted by the European Commission. Notably, the method assists in designing and maintaining IT-based boundary objects while it takes horizontal and vertical division of competences in fed-eral legislative and administrative structures into account. The main contributions of this article are the description of the method, the demonstration of its application, and an evaluation of its utility.",Public administration; IT-based boundary objects; Information exchange; Standardization,"['Geschäftsprozeßmodellierung', ' Workflowmanagement', ' Geschäftsprozess']",en
4484274,A Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval to Support Creativity in Business Processes,"Creativity as the prerequisite for innovation is a core competitive factor in contemporary organizations. When creativity happens this involves creative persons who produce creative products in a process that cannot be fully anticipated and predescribed. We introduce the concept of pockets of creativity for those sections of a business process where creativity occurs. These sections are characterized by a high demand for flexibility and knowledge of the involved creative persons. In pockets of creativity previous knowledge is retrieved, transformed and combined into new procedures or artifacts - in short - innovations. Naturally, this raises the question of how pockets of creativity can be supported by information technology. Information retrieval is part of an organizations knowledge processes concerned with the representation, storage, organization, searching and finding of organizational knowledge. Informed by case studies we have conducted with organizations from the Creative Industries and drawing from existing theory, in this paper we introduce a conceptual framework for information retrieval that enables creative persons to access relevant information through a multi-perspective, hierarchical view. Such an approach both appropriately considers different ways of creative thinking and provides stimuli to a person's cognitive network fostering her creativity and thus the development of truly innovative products.",Information Retrieval; Business Process Management; Creativity; Creativity; intensive Process,"['ERP', ' Enterprise Ressource Planning', ' ERP-Auswahl', ' ERP-Projekt', ' Projektmanagement', ' Softwareeinführung', ' Softwareauswahl', ' Scheitern']",en

In order to reduce the adaptation efforts, the concept of configurative reference modeling represents a promising approach. Nevertheless, since not every requirement of possible reference model users can be anticipated by the reference model developer, further model adaptations have to be performed. In order to support the reference model user decreasing his adaptation efforts by providing a higher methodological support, we propose to integrate generic model adaptation techniques with configurative reference modeling.

It is undisputed that ECM is a requisite technology for meeting issues of compliance, governance, and business process efficiency. However, the high degree of multiplicity and diversity of digital information---nowadays commonly betokend as ""content""---makes it difficult to tailor the implementation of ECM systems (ECMS). In this paper we state tha tconceptual models may provide a suitable means for mapping an organization's individual content situation in order to support the structured analysis and design of ECMS. On the basis of a literature review, we derive specific requirements for content modeling and show that these requirements are not met by conventional modeling languages. We present the ECML, the Enterprise Content Modeling Language, which is specified by means of meta-modeling and illustrated on the basis of a simplified application example.",Conceptual Modeling; Content Model; Enterprise Content Management (ECM); Enterprise Content Modeling Language (ECML),,en

Furthermore, Pan- European directives foster process harmonization and introduction of IT-supported and optimized processes. Hereby activitybased costing can be a useful instrument for process assessment and evaluation. Especially through the introduction of New Public Management and double-entry accounting Public Administrations in Germany now get the opportunity to use costcentered accounting mechanisms to assess process performance and evaluate their activities in a holistic concept. Process Modeling can be a useful instrument to help the public administrations to structure their activities and capture information about them and thereby create a basis for activity-based costing. Therefore, the aim of this article is combining the domain specific process modeling method PICTURE and concept of activity-based costing for supporting Public Administrations in process assessment and evaluation.","['Business Process Assessment', 'Domain Specific Process Modeling Activity-Based Costing', 'E-Government']",,en
4485165,Supporting Creative Group Processes – Groupware for Communication and Coordination,"The idea of the creative individualist spawning innovations as a solitude effort is no longer realistic. Huge innovation projects, relying on project teams, have to be permanently conducted by organizations to assure their competitiveness. These projects often take place in distributed teams, making use of groupware to bridge temporal and geographical distances. Research in social psychology on group processes has revealed that group work suffers from several group process losses such as information overload, production blocking, free riding and evaluation apprehension. Moreover, creative group processes have to be coordinated to assure goal orientation and efficiency. In the shade of the Media Synchronicity Theory and Coordination theory we analyze aspects of communication and coordination support of groupware functionality. We conclude that idea generation should be supported by synchronous groupware functionality whilst idea evaluation merits from asynchronous functionality. Moreover both phases do not depend on single outstanding but various groupware functionalities to support coordination.","['Coordination theory', 'Creativity', 'Group process', 'Groupware', 'Media synchronicity theory']",,en

Especially due to the interdisciplinary character of this new discipline and the imprint of rather behavioral science oriented disciplines, for some problem areas only few innovative artifacts have been scientifically published and evaluated. To counter this deficiency, we present a research framework for design research in the service science discipline. The framework is based on design (science) research literature and widely acknowledged service science perspectives. It addresses three dimensions: (1) four IT artifact types, (2) four perspectives on the service science, and (3) three levels of abstraction. Using the framework, gaps in the service science discipline yet to be addressed by IT artifacts can be identified. On the other hand, if abundant IT artifacts can be identified for any of the proposed research areas, artifacts might need to be systematized or combined.",Service Science Management and Engineering; Service science; Design research; Research framework,,en

However, this diversity does not come without misunderstandings that are rooted in differing assumptions, mental models, and attitudes. Accordingly, theories and artifacts developed in different sub-disciplines of service science differ significantly. Therefore, concepts and meanings need to be negotiated continuously. In this paper, we report on the results of an explorative analysis of four standardization endeavors that have recently been conducted in the field of hybrid value creation in Germany. This analysis is performed against the backdrop of (a) design theory, (b) the concept of sensemaking, and (c) actor network theory, all of which have been argued to be relevant in a standardization context. Based on our analysis, we identify some first assumptions that shape different mind-sets related to the integration of physical goods and services. Due to the work-in-progress state of our analysis, we conclude the paper with presenting some ideas for extending, systematizing, and testing the results.",,,en

4485925,A Conceptual Framework for Information Retrieval in Pockets of Creativity,"Creativity as the prerequisite for innovation is a core competitive factor in contemporary organizations. When creativity happens this involves creative persons who produce creative products in a process of imagination. We introduce the concept of Pockets of Creativity for those sections of a business process where creativity occurs. These sections are characterised by a high demand for flexibility and knowledge of the involved creative persons. In Pockets of Creativity previous knowledge is retrieved, transformed and combined into new procedures or artefacts - in short - innovations. Naturally, this raises the question of how Pocketsof Creativity can be supported by Information Technology. Informed by the Cognitive Network Model by Santanen et al. and the work of Amabile and others, in this paper we introduce a conceptual framework for information retrieval that suggests creative persons to access relevant information through a multiperspective, hierarchical view. Thus, people's differing worldviews and approaches to creative-thinking are considered. At the same time, such an approach can provide stimuli to invoke the discovery of entry points to areas of a person's cognitive network that have not been considered efore. Through this, people may be able to think imaginatively and to combine seemingly differentconcepts to truly creative and innovative products. We suggest to consider the process as a whole as knowledge is created, retrieved, transferred and applied within business processes.",Copnceptual Framework; Creativity; Information Retrieval; Pockets of Creativity,"['Dynamic capabilities, Qualitative research, Resource-based view, Service innovation']",en

Predictability and response to incidents in process executions are challenging. With Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM), researchers propose an approach for overcoming these problems through proactive monitoring and notification of crucial process activities across the supply chain. The identification and definition of such crucial activities and information needs are necessary to handle possible abnormalities although they are challenging task which have not been solved in SCEM research so far. Hence, we propose a modeling approach which allows the conceptual specification of an adequate information exchange along the supply chain. With our approach we focus on the specification of relevant logistical objects,the definition of possible events, and the design of notifications for decision makers in the supply chain.",Conceptual Modeling; Supply Chain Event Management; SCEM,,en

4487081,Public Sector Business Intelligence - An Open Source Approach,"Approaches to strategic Information Systems (IS) are standard in private organisations. In Public Administrations (PA), however, only first steps towards strategic managing support are undertaken. Deficits become apparent especially regarding new public management (NPM) approaches, such as new accounting systems or an output-oriented management. While PA are often obliged to implement such NPM approaches in order to collect management-relevant data, there is little support regarding how to employ these new structures in terms of strategic management. Here, Balanced Scorecards (BSC) can provide a valuable strategic management instrument. Core problems that such an approach faces in the domain of PA are domain specific requirements, data collection problems in a heterogeneous IS environment, and financial limitations due to budgetary restrictions. This paper presents a design science-oriented case study on BSC design and organisational implementation in a medium-sized local PA. It introduces a solution based on an Open Source Software (OSS) approach which addresses the problem of data collection by BSC and project management software integration. A case study analysis identifies generalisable issues which can potentially be applied to other situational and organisational contexts.","['Design science case study', 'New public management', 'Open source software', 'Public administration', 'Strategic information systems']",,

To date, however, it remains unclear how satisfied institutions are with various modelling languages as there is a lack of studies on modelling and analyzing business processes. In order to provide a better understanding of this issue, an exploratory survey with a focus on the banking sector was conducted. Due to a structural crisis in the financial sector (esp. in Germany, where the market is seen as &ldquo;over-banked&rdquo; and &ldquo;over- branched&rdquo;), banks are currently forced to improve their business processes to save costs and work more efficiently. Thus, they focus on business process management (BPM) and in particular on the preliminary steps of business process modelling. In this paper, key findings from a survey are presented and discussed as a basis for a more sophisticated approach to business process modelling and analysis in the future and also as an insight into the state of the art of business process modelling in general.","['Banks', 'BPM', 'Business Process Modelling Languages', 'Empirical Research', 'Survey']",,en

The approach does not depend on any particular modeling language which is achieved by treating conceptual models as labeled graphs. Consequently, we use pattern matching techniques known from algorithmic graph theory &ndash; subgraph isomorphism and subgraph homeomorphism. In general, algorithms solving these problems can be computationally expensive. However, special properties of conceptual models such as low treewidth and planarity can be exploited to keep computational complexity manageable. This makes pattern matching appli-cable even to large models typically used in large companies or corporate groups. We introduce a high-level meta algorithm checking structural properties of input models and patterns to decide which low-level pattern matching algorithm will likely deliver search results quickest.",conceptual modeling; conceptual model analysis; pattern matching; subgraph isomorphism; subgraph homeomorphism; planarity; treewidth,,en

4487903,Model Based Identification and Measurement of Reorganization Potential in Public Administrations – the PICTURE-Approach,"Public administrations are faced with a modernization and performance gap. On the one hand citizens and companies have increasing requirements. On the other hand the financial and human resources remain static or even decrease. In recent years public administrations tried to counteract with reengineering their business processes. However, it is observable that reengineering projects in public administrations have a too narrow focus as they concentrate on a small subset of their overall processes. In this paper we claim that significant progress in the identification and measurement of reorganization potential can only be achieved by including the majority of all administrational processes &ndash; the process landscape. Therefore, we propose a method architecture which is capable of two things: Firstly, it supports a distributed modeling process across a whole public administration in order to capture the process landscape. Secondly, it is able to estimate the reorganization potential within the process landscape based on an analysis model. A working example derived from a currently funded EU project is supplemented in order to demonstrate our approach and to make it more comprehensible to the reader.",Methods and tools for assessment; Methods and tools for eGov research; Process; design and change; Method engineering; International and regional projects,"['E-Government', ' Dienstleistungskatalog', ' Wissensexpli-kation', ' Informationsmodellierung']",en

4488314,Constructing Comparable Business Process Models with Domain Specific Languages - An Empirical Evaluation,"The objective of this paper is to evaluate the semantic building block-based approach as a means for improving comparability in business process modelling. It is described whether and why the semantic building block-based approach reduces the variations in comparison to traditional modelling approaches. Our argumentation is grounded on the assumption that business process modelling projects in large organisations have to be conducted in a distributed manner. However, the goal of these projects is to integrate single models into a consistent process landscape. This allows the organisation to mine the processes for potential improvements. A lack of comparability could deteriorate the quality of the process landscape and the analysis performed on its basis. In a laboratory experiment the variations of distributed process modelling in the traditional and the building block-based approach have been compared. Results indicate that the semantic building block-based approach leads to considerably fewer variations between business process models and, thus, improves the comparability of them.","['Business process modelling', 'Domain specific languages', 'Model comparison', 'Picture']","['Business process management, Contract formulation, Customer integration, Method engineering, Outsourcing, Service processes']",en

On the one hand citizens and companies have increasing requirements but on the other hand the financial and human resources remain static or even decrease. In recent years public administrations tried to counteract with reengineering their business processes. However, it is observable that reengineering projects in public administrations have a too narrow focus as they concentrate on a small subset of the processes. This reengineering limitation originates from the complexity of the administrational process landscape and from the resulting high modeling effort. In this paper we claim that significant progress in the identification and assessment of reorganization potential can only be achieved by including the majority of all administrational processes. Therefore, we propose a method architecture which is capable of two things: First, it supports a distributed modeling process across a whole public administration in order to capture the process landscape. Second, it is able to estimate the reorganization potential within the process landscape based on a certain analysis model.",Methods and tools for assessment; Methods and tools for eGov research; Process design and change; Analysis of values for stakeholders; International; and regional projects,,en

From a company's perspective it is important to understand the concrete contribution of an RFID system with regard to individual processes. The problem of profitability analyses in IS is that such technologies cannot be calculated as an economic standard investment. Hence, we propose a reference model as a generic knowledge base for referential RFID impacts. Our model supports the structuring and evaluation of RFID benefits along business processes. With this, we propose indicators for the derivation of an RFID cause-and-effectchain. The allocation of RFID effects to processes within the reference framework helps in identifying the right logistic unit levels for RFID transponder investments.","['Business value', 'Process-driven analysis', 'RFID investments']",,

This integration mainly takes place during the post-merger integration (PMI) phase of an M&A endeavor. In this phase, well-defined IT governance is critical to success since it specifies the decision rights and an accountability framework to encourage a desirable course of the IT integration. It harmonizes IT-related integration issues with desired behaviors and business objectives. In this paper, we provide a framework for IT Governance in the PMI phase (ITGoPMI). The ITGoPMI framework can serve as a blueprint for the specification of organizational units and their decision fields when the IT functions of two companies become one. We are developing the framework according to the principles of design science research in an iterative manner. Preliminary versions of the framework were evaluated through expert interviews. They approved that the here presented version of our ITGoPMI framework already has the potential to serve as a beneficial guideline for post-merger IT integration in practice. Nevertheless, we will continue our research process with further evaluation and improvement of the framework.","['Design science', 'IT governance', 'Mergers and acquisitions', 'Organizational change']","['Governance', ' Collaboration', ' Business process management networks', ' Process management', ' Country comparison', ' Quantitative study']",

Modelling methods extensions for specifying and analysing customer integration,"Service Provider business processes require extensive customer participation. Due to the customer's substantial impact on the successful implementation of performance processes, measures of customer interaction must be planned meticulously. At present, there are numerous modelling techniques for a model-based structuring of these processes. Admittedly, most of these models provide only general operations for model modifications such as the ability to delete and add elements. This paper demonstrates possible extensions for process modelling techniques which are intended to assist service providers in analysing their processes with particular regard to customer integration and contract formulation.","['Business process management', 'Contract formulation', 'Customer integration', 'Method engineering', 'Outsourcing', 'Service processes']","['Clinical Pathway', ' Process Modeling Methodology', ' Process Modeling Tool']",en

However, citizens' willingness to use these applications is still rather small. As proved by surveys, one major reason for this lacking acceptance is security concerns. In this paper, we investigate the role of mass media in this process of creating mistrust towards eGovernment. In doing so, we analyse three different newspapers concerning their way of reporting on IT risks and security issues in eGovernment systems using the method of content analysis. It shows that their news coverage is indeed quite biased and emotional possibly influencing the readers' attitudes towards eGovernment systems. Different media effect theories predict various models of affecting the recipients' stance, some of which are applied in our analysis. The outcome of this research is a set of assumptions stating in which way the communication of security issues in eGovernment systems in mass media influences the audience's attitudes.","['eGovernment', 'IT risks', 'mass media', 'media effect theory']",,en
4490213,Performance Benchmarking for Designing Interaction Routines – Managing Trade-offs in Service Co-creation with the Data Envelopment Analysis,"The co-creation of value involving service provider and service customer is one of the most widely acknowledged properties of &lsquo;service&rsquo;. From an operations view, a central challenge is to organize the co-creation of service(s) in the most efficient way. Previous literature in supply chain management and economics is focused on developing various simulation approaches and analytical models, but takes insufficient account of the basic properties of service. The purpose of this article is to conceptualize service co-creation as performed in stable interaction routines between service providers and customers that can be purposefully designed and optimized for efficiency. We argue that finding the most efficient interaction routine is subject to solving a trade-off decision between a set of performance factors such as service quality, cost, and customer involvement. This trade-off decision can be resolved with the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), allowing service providers to optimize their interactions with their customers by shifting activities in the service process towards the customer, into the service provider&rsquo;s front stage, or into the service provider&rsquo;s back stage. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is usable in this context, discuss its theoretical properties, and suggest research directions for its further development.",Service Science; Service Blueprinting; Performance Feedback Theory; Behavioural Theory of the Firm; Data Envelopment Analysis,,en
4490282,How to Increase Service Productivity: A BPM Perspective,"The service sector has experienced a remarkable growth in most advanced economies over the last decades. Services are processes that transfer inputs into outputs through interaction between customer and provider. The performance of service processes can be measured in terms of service productivity. Service productivity, expressing the relationship between service outcome and the resources required, is a key measure to service providers. In this literature review, we take a BPM perspective to examine which practices extant studies suggest to help service managers to increase productivity of service processes. We assign 15 recommendations which we are able to identify from the literature review to the phases design, configuration, enactment, and diagnosis according to the BPM lifecycle. Based on these recommendations, we outline three interconnected areas of future research from which the service industry could benefit. These are cross-boundary BPM, understanding IT support for service processes, and contributions of design science. This study takes a fresh look on service productivity as it offers a novel systemization and synthesis of the diverse recommendations present in the literature. The implications we discuss go beyond common beaten tracks as they bring forward the new opportunities of growing digital connectedness that also exist for traditional services as well as the formation of networks and increasing collaboration within the service sector.",Service Science; Service Management; Productivity; Business Process Management; Literature Review,,en
4490351,Data Warehouse Design and Legal Visualization – The Applicability of H2 for Reporting,"The steady increase of regulations and its acceleration due to the financial crisis heavily affect the management of regulatory compliance. Regulations, such as Basel III and Solvency II particularly impact data warehouses and lead to many organizational and technical changes. From an IS perspective modeling techniques for data warehouse requirement elicitation help to manage conceptual requirements. From a legal perspective attempts to visualize regulatory requirements - so called legal visualization approaches - have been developed. This paper investigates whether a conceptual modeling technique for regulatory-driven data warehouse requirements is applicable for representing data warehouse requirements in a legal environment. Applying the modeling technique H2 for Reporting in three extensive modeling projects provides three contributions. First, evidence for the applicability of a modeling technique for regulatory-driven data warehouse requirements is given. Second, lessons learned for further modeling projects are provided. Third, a discussion towards a combined perspective of information modeling and legal visualization is presented.",Legal Visualization; Regulatory Financial Reporting; Compliance; Conceptual Modeling; Data Warehouse,,en

Due to inaccurate conceptual specifications, IS projects can be delayed or even fail. Thus, thorough evaluation of models is a major concern in IS research. Consequently, theoretical models are required which elucidate the conditions for the successful evaluability of conceptual models. However, IS literature only provides little insights about the prerequisites of effective evaluation. Systematic investigations on the evaluability of conceptual models are missing. Therefore, is paper aims at two research results. Firstly, based on a comprehensive literature review we propose a theoretical model of perceived evaluability. This theoretical model rests on the influence of domain knowledge and the perceived comprehensibility of conceptual models as its two main impact factors. Secondly, to prepare an empirical evaluation of the theoretical model, the development of measurement scales is described. The first steps of this process are exemplified based on an inquiry of modeling experts and implications for testing our hypotheses are provided.",Conceptual modeling; evaluation; ontology; domain knowledge; construct development,,en

4491109,Business Rule Based Extension of a Semantic Process Modeling Language for Managing Business Process Compliance in the Financial Sector,Managing business process compliance is an important topic in the financial sector. Various scandals and the financial crisis have caused many new constraints and legal regulations that banks and financial institutions have to face. Based on a domain-specific semantic business process modeling notation we propose generic process compliance business rules that serve as a first step towards the identification of individual compliance business rule patterns in banks. These rules can be seen as a basis for the automatic identification of compliance issues in existing processes (process models) and hence for managing business process compliance in the financial sector.,,,
4491176,"Local, Participative Process Modelling - The PICTURE-Approach","Process modelling is regarded as an important activity within Business Process Management (BPM) projects. A common modelling procedure has been established that is based on a prioritisation, documentation, and analysis of the business processes. However, it can be difficult to apply this procedure when only very little is known about an organisation as it presupposes some knowledge about the process structure. In this paper we present local, participative modelling as an alternative to this approach. With the process modelling method PICTURE an implementation of local, participative modelling is presented. With this specific view of knowledge acquisition in mind PICTURE is compared with the workflow patterns of van der Aalst et al. [2] in order to identify similarities and differences. Based on this analysis suggestions for the further development of the PICTURE method are derived.",PICTURE; workflow patterns; process modelling approaches; sequential modelling; electronic government,"['Controlling', ' Handel', ' Handels-H', ' Handelscontrolling', ' Kennzahlen', ' Reporting']",en
4491245,The Impact of Data Quality on Value Based Management of Financial Institutions,"Data quality plays a crucial role for financial institutions. Some would even say that data quality is one of the principal reasons for the current financial crisis. Anyway, sufficient data quality is needed to make well-informed business decisions. The dependence on good data quality is especially high if value based management is applied, since then the control of an institution only depends on a few selected key indicators. Bad data quality will lead to inaccurate indicators. To achieve a higher level of data quality, financial institutions need to invest in data quality projects. Although they are generally willing to do this, data quality projects need to be justified through business cases. In this research-in-progress paper, we present the results of a survey in which we asked German financial institutions to give their perspective on the influence of data quality on value based management. The findings of this study provide the basis for our future research as we finally aim at developing a business case model that financial institutions can apply to prepare business cases for data quality projects.","['Business case model', 'Data quality', 'Financial institutions', 'Value based management']",,

4491511,Business Process Governance: A Comparative Study of Germany and Japan,"Purpose: Business process management (BPM) networks have become an important theme in both research and practice. Drawing from governance theory, this paper seeks to provide a theoretical understanding of BPM networks and introduce three types of BPM governance: market, network, and hierarchy. Subsequently, it aims to study the impact of BPM maturity, organization size, and financial stress (independent variables) on the three types of BPM governance (dependent variable). Design/methodology/approach: After a thorough literature analysis a quantitative study is conducted. Comprehensive data of 538 local public administration in Germany and Japan is comparatively studied by means of a PLS (model and multi group) analysis. Findings: The empirical study provides evidence for the significant dependence of BPM governance on contextual variables: the configuration of the BPM network relies on the BPM maturity and the perceived financial stress. Also, such dependence does vary between the two countries. Higher financial stress leads to more higher network sourcing in Germany and to higher market sourcing in Japan, respectively. Practical implications: This study suggests that the role of process managers changes over time. In immature organizations, process managers appear to work alone and struggle for resources. However, once organizations start to mature, the role changes to that of an ""orchestrator of different actors."" Process managers in future public organizations (assuming a positive development of capabilities), both in Asian and European settings, must be able to collaborate with actors from different governance mechanisms. Originality/value: First, the paper provides a governance-theory based understanding of BPM networks. It introduces market-type, network-type, and hierarchy-type BPM governance and thereby provides greater conceptual and theoretical clarity of this important phenomenon. So far, this research area has been under-theorized. Second, the paper provides a theory that explains BPM network governance. Here, relevant contextual variables are taken into account, including the BPM maturity of an organization. Third, the paper contributes comprehensive empirical insights into BPM networks structures, governance mechanisms, and their dependence on contextual variables (especially the BPM maturity of an organization). Fourth, it provides an ample comparative theory-based analysis of BPM networks in two different countries. Such an endeavor, as to the author's best knowledge, has not yet been undertaken so far. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Governance; Collaboration; Business process management networks; Process management; Country comparison; Quantitative study,,en

4491648,Towards a Methodology and a Tool for Modeling Clinical Pathways,"Nowadays hospitals face the problem of increasing quality and at the same time reducing costs of their services. Clinical pathways approach has established itself as an effective method of reorganization of medical practice in a process-oriented way. Since more than a decade, clinical pathways are being created and applied in hospitals in the USA, Australia, and European countries. Traditional text-based approach for documenting clinical pathways does not allow automatic analysis and makes the maintenance of the models inefficient. Recently, researchers started to apply generic modeling languages, such as UML activity diagrams, EPC or BPMN, as well as domain specific process modeling languages, in order to formalize the representation of clinical pathways. However, none of these languages sufficiently covers the requirements of clinical pathway models, and the choice of a suitable modeling technique remains a problem. In this paper, we propose a modeling methodology and a modeling tool for creating graphical semantically annotated models of clinical pathways. We take into account the characteristics and usage scenarios of clinical pathways and show, how the proposed approach addresses these requirements.",Clinical Pathway; Process Modeling Methodology; Process Modeling Tool,,en

Existing IS research in the field of e-Government suggests that the relationship between these two worlds has high potential for conflict and can be crucial for a project's success. But an in-depth analysis of this specific relationship is still missing. We observed the German e-Government project 'online car registration' with a case study research approach. During the case analysis we developed a framework for the description and classification of the relationship of IS and law. The frameworks dimensions are the perceived influence direction (IS → Law, Law → IS, IS ←→ Law), the perceived influence character (Positive, Negative, Ambivalent) and the perceived influence impact (Restrictive, Demanding, Enabling). We use this framework to structure the case and to derive project management recommendations on how to manage the relationship of IS and law in e-Government projects. The framework can further be used as a basis for a more in-depth systematic literature analysis or empirical case analyses.","['Case study', 'E-Government', 'Framework', 'IS', 'Law', 'Legal', 'Relationship']",,en

Hence, organizations need to implement a convenient innovation strategy to remain competitive in constantly changing market environments. To identify, design and implement possible service innovation, organizations already successfully cooperate with external partners, suppliers, customers or internally through different functional departments. In so doing, organizational boundaries occur with respect to unequally distributed knowledge. This disparity needs to be overcome by spanning different groups through technology. In this article, we analyze what kind of IT artifact, so called boundary object, can be used within a service innovation. To this end, we conduct an empirical investigation in 500 German SMEs with the aim of identifying suitable boundary objects for each stage of a service innovation process.

4493150,Formalizing Linguistic Conventions for Conceptual Models,"A precondition for the appropriate analysis of conceptual models is not only their syntactic correctness but also their semantic comparability. Assuring comparability is challenging especially when models are developed by different persons. Empirical studies show that such models can vary heavily, especially in model element naming, even if they express the same issue. In contrast to most ontology-driven approaches proposing the resolution of these differences ex-post, we introduce an approach that avoids naming differences in conceptual models already during modeling. Therefore we formalize naming conventions combining domain thesauri and phrase structures based on a lin-guistic grammar. This allows for guiding modelers automatically during the modeling process using standardized labels for model elements. Our approach is generic, making it applicable for any modeling language.",Conceptual Modeling; Naming Conventions; Computational Linguistics,,en

4493294,Explaining the Behavioral Intention Towards BI Implementation in Public Administrations: A Principal-agent Theory Approach,"Business Intelligence (BI) is an established instrument to support public administrations in their management tasks by increasing their information level. BI is of special interest in the context of introducing accrual accounting in public administrations as this affects the information level of different stakeholders, leading to a possible decrease for municipal councils. The principal-agent theory can help to explain different behavioral intentions of the stakeholders concerning the introduction of BI. We employ a single qualitative case study to analyze these behavioral intentions. It shows that the introduction of accrual accounting did decrease the information level of the municipal council making the principal-agent problems possible. Furthermore, it shows that BI might be a solution for this problem. Therefore, council members show the behavioral intention to support the BI implementation while administration staff members rather resist it. Based on these finding, we discuss implications for practice and future research. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","['Business Intelligence', 'EGovernment', 'Empirical Study', 'Organizational Change', 'Principal-Agent Theory']",,en

4493507,Constructing a Semantic Business Process Modelling Language for the Banking Sector – An Evolutionary Dyadic Design Science Approach,"The need to extensively model business processes for multiple purposes (e.g., documentation, compliance management, analysis and optimisation etc.) is of major relevance to banks. Efficiently modelling and automatically analysing business process models not only in a syntactical but also in a semantic way becomes increasingly important in order to save costs during process model construction and achieve additional value from process modelling initiatives. In this article, we introduce a domain-specific semantic business process modelling language (BPML), which supports efficient modelling and semantic analysis needs of banks. We do this by adapting an existing domain-specific BPML from the public sector and applying an evolutionary design science research approach that covers several design science cycle iterations. We triangulate and evaluate the final design science artefact (a new semantic BPML for banks) with the help of a multi-method approach using interviews, round table discussions, document analysis, literature analysis and two in-depth case studies from a specialised bank and a universal bank in the financial sector.",,,en

This paper proposes a set of guidelines for the representation of business models. Based on recent conceptualizations of business models and argumentation theory, we develop a comprehensive framework for the representation of a business model&rsquo;s structure and the logic of how the individual parts are assembled. We argue that adhering to these guidelines untangles the visualization of business models. In addition this approach also propels a comprehensible design process since the structure of the argumentation is laid down explicitly, thereby supporting critical reflection. In a similar way, applying our approach to existing business models helps evaluating them critically since new vantage points within the argumentation can be revealed with ease.",business model; modeling; business strategy; design science,"['Service Science', ' Productvity', ' DEA']",en

It consists of macro, meso and micro navigation. A conceptual approach to model and implement the macro navigation structure of web sites is presented. We start by enhancing a function decomposition diagram to model the macro navigation structure. The resulting graph is analysed and transformed to find its crucial components. In order to store these components in a database table, an appropriate entity-relationship model is developed. Afterwards we identify three navigation styles that can be produced from the underlying database and give the PHP source code for one of them. Finally, an example web page using our navigation styles is depicted. It is concluded that using our ideas may lead to reduced development time and avoids link errors in the process of creating the site navigation.",,,en

Service businesses are faced with two particular challenges that introduce the need to trade-off metrics against each other. First, their rather intangible and perishable properties require incorporating non- financial performance indicators such as perceived quality or resource utilization into the calculus. Second, the nature of service systems as open systems makes performance calculations subject to different perspectives on value creation. Traditional approaches to resolve these conflicts are mostly based on weighting the metrics a priori based translating management strategies into action, which might lead to biased performance calculations. With a comparative example, we demonstrate to what extend the DEA is able to resolve these trade-offs without specifying a priori weights which offers the chance to compare unbiased data with current strategic objectives.",Performance Management; Service Science; Benchmarking; Data Envelopment Analysis,,en

However, evaluations of the resulting architectures have shown that there is a need for structured design methods which allow for the consistent engineering and management of the respective models. Since we observed repetitive patterns in BAM queries for service monitoring, we have started the engineering of a pattern language to increase consistency and generally ease the design process. Based on an evaluation of related work, we present more than two dozen requirements of general nature as well as requirements for sourcing, calculation, and evaluation definitions and discuss these.",,,en
4494598,Consulting – a Creativity-Intensive Process? Insights from an Exploratory Case Study,"Creativity is an important predecessor of any innovation and a competitive factor in many industries. However, only little is known about the management of business processes that are coined by creativity. The theory of managing creativity-intensive processes provides an analytical perspective for the understanding and management of these processes. Consulting processes, at first sight, seem non-creative but show strong parallels to creativity-intensive processes (CIP). In this paper we confirm the validity of the theory's core concept and its properties with data from a multi-case study within the consulting industry. We contribute to the qualitative empirical validation of the TMCP and thus support the generalization of the theory. Moreover, the TMPC contains strategies that organizations can employ in order to manage CIPs. In showing that consulting processes are CIPs, these strategies can be transferred, as a practical contribution, to the management of consulting processes. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","['Business processes management', 'Case study', 'Consulting', 'Creativity']",,en

4495364,"Engineering, Sales, and Delivery of Modular Value Bundles – A Framework for Configurative Modeling","<p>The increasing dominance of the service sector (OECD, 2005) further amplifies the need for traditional physical goods suppliers to develop and provide integrated value bundles for their customers. Often, the value of such an integrated solution – consisting of product and service components – is (perceived) higher than the added value of the separate product and service components. From the customer's point of view outcomes of value bundles can be tangible and/or intangible (Vargo/Lusch, 2004). While customers are supposed to perceive the delivered value proposition as an inseparable solution, manufacturers and service providers need to coordinate their distinct products, services, business processes, and resources in order to effectively and efficiently deliver an integrated value proposition. Therefore, service systems require executing traditional manufacturing processes, which aim at providing physical goods of value for customers, as well as service processes, which due to their very nature are conducted in cooperation with the customer (Sampson/Froehle, 2006; Fitzsimmons/ Fitzsimmons, 2001; Tuli et al., 2007).<br /></p>",Configurative Modeling; Service Science; Value Bundle,"['Informationsmodellierung', ' Bezeichungskonventionen', ' Linguistik']",en

4495707,How to Model Service Productivity for Data Envelopment Analysis? A Meta-Design Approach,"The rise of the service economy is increasingly reflected in the IS discipline. Since services depend on a co-creation of value between service providers and customers, productivity measurement needs to account for both points of view. Contrasting this evolution, current productivity management concepts often remain limited to the firm instead of focusing on dyadic relationships. Also, software tools frequently constitute expert systems that are focused on solving an optimization problem based on a linear program, but do not guide users in setting up a suitable productivity model in the first place. To account for this need, we conceptualize a software tool support for setting up productivity models for services. Our concept encompasses an extended Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach as its analytical core, but in addition features various tools that help users to collaboratively define a productivity measurement model. Since the suitability of such a model is contingent on the environment in which it is applied, the proposed concept constitutes a meta-design that is intended to be applicable to a class of productivity management problems. As an outlook we present ideas for further research focusing on the implementation and evaluation of IT artefacts compliant with the proposed meta-design.",Productivity Measurement; Service Science; Data Envelopment Analysis; Design Science,,en

We introduce an architecture supporting creative group processes in the context of business processes. Based on the theoretical concept of Pockets of Creativity (Seidel et al. 2010), the architecture aims to balance freedom for creative group work and constraints set by the processes in its environment. The architecture is implemented in the prototype CreativeFlow, integrating a groupware component and a workflow component. The prototype is evaluated in a case study in a TV production company. Free participation in group tasks and support for the structuring of ideas were deemed appropriate for the support of creative group processes. Process structure is mainly imposed by project deadlines that require user notification, also outside the workflow component. Process orientation is a promising approach to increase the efficiency of the creative value creation.","['Artifact Evaluation', 'Case Study', 'Creative Group Processes', 'Groupware']",,en

So far process modeling has been mainly performed with generic process modeling languages. These approaches have however limitations when it comes to the needs of specific problem domains or automated process analysis. Semantic building block based languages (SBBL) aim to overcome those limitations by integrating domain semantics in the modeling language. However, this class of languages is only useful if they exhibit the same expressiveness as generic languages. In this paper we strive to answer this question by comparing the expressiveness of the SBBL language PICTURE with ARIS as a generic language based on the Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology, showing that PICTURE has hardly construct deficits compared to ARIS while showing less construct redundancy and construct overload in its constructs.",,,en

Designing, proposing and providing customer solutions (consisting of physical goods and services) takes place in product-service systems, which may comprise manufacturing companies, service companies and customers. Conceptual modeling is an established approach to support such efforts. In this paper, a method for selectively designing conceptual modeling languages is proposed and demonstrated. Departing from outlining the general properties of value creation in product-service systems, a catalogue of modeling requirements in this area is compiled based on analyzing the perspectives of four sub-disciplines on service research. An evaluation of a set of modeling languages with this catalogue reveals that the languages incompletely address the requirements. Therefore, an approach to selectively design new modeling languages for product-service systems is proposed based on integrating and extending the meta models of other modeling languages. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","['Meta modeling', 'Modeling languages', 'Product-service systems']","['Normung', ' Standardisierung', ' Hybride Wertschöpfung', ' Dienstleistungsforschung']",en

In order to leverage complementary resources and capabilities fully, the network actors must span traditional boundaries between communities of practice in manufacturing and service. Fields like supply chain management and business process management, as well as the literature on boundary spanning, offer little guidance for the systematic identification of boundary objects that could be used to bridge this gap. Drawing on existing works on boundary objects and service blueprinting, we design a new method for diagnosing boundary-spanning processes and identifying candidates for IT-based boundary objects that integrate manufacturing and service companies' subprocesses. The method was iteratively developed over a period of three years in a cyclic action research project with two business-to-business service networks in the mechanical and electrical engineering industries.",Service networks; boundary spanning; service blueprinting; business process management; action research,"['Conceptual Modelling', ' Model Comparison', ' Domain Thesaurus', ' Computational Linguistics', ' Comparability']",en

Within the scope of eGovernment initiatives in the last few years, administrations try to overcome this gap by reorganizing and automating their business processes. In order to increase the quality of operations and processes, reference process models can be used as a valuable design support. Reference process models show a high level of reusability and thus allow for an extensive exploitation of synergy potentials as well as a reduction of redundancies. For the design of reference process models public administrations need to identify the best practice or common practice within the regarded domain. In order to support the identification of best practice or common practice a communication platform is needed that contains process descriptions of the specific administrations that can be provided by the administrations themselves. The aim of our paper is to propose a conceptual framework of such a web based platform as well as application scenarios in the German public administration domain.",,"['service discovery', ' ontology', ' information retrieval', ' experiment']",en

To tackle these two issues, we design and evaluate a collaborative filtering recommender system which (a) makes individualized<br />recommendations of potentially interesting value-added services when customers express interest in a particular physical product and also (b) obtains estimations of a customer's willingness-to-pay to allow for a dynamic, value-based pricing of those services. The recommender system is based on an adapted conjoint analysis method combined with a stepwise componential segmentation algorithm to collect preference and willingness-to-pay data for value-added services. Compared to other conjointbased recommendation approaches, our system requires significantly less customer input before making a recommendation and at the same time does not suffer from the usual cold-start problem of<br />recommender systems. And, as is shown in an empirical evaluation with a representative sample of 428 customers in the machine tool market, our approach does not diminish the predictive accuracy of the recommendations offered.",Model-Based Recommendations; Service Science; Design Science; E-Commerce (B2B),,en

The results of this workshop suggest that BPM research can meaningfully contribute to investigating a broad variety of phenomena that are of interest to IS scholars, ranging from rather technical (e.g., the implementation of software architectures) to managerial (e.g., the impact of organizational culture on process performance). It further becomes noticeable that BPM researchers can make use of several research strategies, including qualitative, quantitative, and design-oriented approaches. The article offers the participants&rsquo; outlook on the future of BPM research and combines their opinions with research results from the academic literature on BPM, with the goal of contributing to establishing BPM as a distinct field of research in the IS discipline.",,,en
4498198,Modeling and Checking Business Process Compliance Rules in the Financial Sector,"Assuring compliance of business processes with legal and internal regulations is crucial for financial institutions, as non-compliance may lead to severe financial and juridical penalties. To ensure business process compliance, process models have been established as a widely accepted basis for the design, documentation and control of the implementation of business process rules. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce a semi-automatic business process compliance checking approach based on process models and related models. It relies on graph-based pattern matching, which makes it possible in contrast to existing approaches to define and check any possible type of business rule in any possible type of business process model or even other type of model. The approach is embedded in a design science research methodology. © (2011) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office, All rights reserved.","['Business process compliance', 'Business rules', 'Conceptual modeling', 'Financial sector', 'Model checking', 'Pattern matching']",,en

4498334,Extending the Supply Chain Operations Reference Model: Potentials and their Tool Support,The SCOR-Model is one of the most applied reference models to support the description of supply chains. It owes its wide dissemination particularly the activities of the Supply chain council with its close to 1.000 members from practice and research. The paper investigates potentials for future extensions of the model. On the basis of an explorative survey of 20 professionals a framework for extension potentials of the SCOR-Model was developed. By an exhaustive analysis of 53 case studies this framework was affirmed. The framework is used to analyse requirements on modelling tools to support the application of a respective extended SCOR-Model. A concept of a tool support which accomplishes most of the requirements is described and realised as a prototype which is introduced in this paper. With the presented tool concept the basis for a progressive extension strategy for the SCORModel is provided which opens new perspectives for the Supply chain council.,"['Configuration', 'Reference Modelling', 'Supply Chain Management', 'Supply Chain Operations Reference Model']",,en

4498679,Towards Increased Comparability of Conceptual Models - Enforcing Naming Conventions through Domain Thesauri and Linguistic Grammars,"Distributed construction of conceptual models may lead to a set of problems when these models are tobe compared or integrated. Different kinds of comparison conflicts are known (e.g. naming conflictsor structural conflicts), the resolution of which is subject of different approaches. However, the expostresolution of naming conflicts raises subsequent problems that origin from semantic diversities ofnamings - even if they are syntactically the same. Therefore, we propose an approach that allows foravoiding naming conflicts in conceptual models already during modelling. This way, the ex-postresolution of naming conflicts becomes obsolete. In order to realise this approach we combine domainthesauri as lexical conventions for the use of terms, and linguistic grammars as conventions for validphrase structures. The approach is generic in order to make it reusable for any conceptual modellinglanguage.",Conceptual Modelling; Model Comparison; Domain Thesaurus; Computational Linguistics; Comparability,,en

4498818,Ontology Support For Configurative Reference Modelling,"The manual customisation of reference models to suite special purposes is an exhaustive task that has to be accomplished thoroughly to preserve, explicit and extend the inherit intention. This can be facilitated by the usage of automatisms like those being provided by the configurative reference modelling approach. Thus, the reference model has to be enriched by data describing for which application scenario a certain element is relevant. By assigning this data to application contexts, this structure builds a taxonomy. This taxonomy can be extended by relationships between the elements, thus forming an ontology. The paper illustrates the advantage of the usage of such ontologies during three relevant phases of the lifecycle of configurative reference models. Furthermore, algorithms for the evaluation f the ontology and the deduction of the resulting effects are presented. Finally, the functional efficiency is proven by demonstrating the application of the approach using a software tool for reference modelling.",Ontology Support; Configurative Reference Models; Tools; Model Lifecycle,,en

However, the success of BPR projects in banks varies significantly and it remains a challenge to systematically discover weaknesses in business process landscapes. In particular, automatic semantic analysis of business processes for different types of weaknesses (i.e. media breaks, redundant consistency checks, or missing or inconsistent information) is yet in its infancy. Value from business process modeling can, however, only be unveiled when time-consuming, mostly manual business process analysis is performed and results in business process optimization. In this paper we develop a methodology for semi-automatic analysis and detection of weaknesses in semantically analyzable business process models. We argue that this contributes to systematically identify possible weaknesses in process models more efficiently and more effectively than manual analysis.",Automatic Business Process Analysis; Semantic Business Process Models; Process Weaknesses; Business Process Optimization; Business Process Reengineering,,en

However, recent research indicates that banks are not very satisfied with general purpose business process modeling languages.

Coming from a real-life case in the banking industry, we introduce a business process modeling language using semantic process building blocks for banks.",Semantic Process Modeling; Business Process Modeling Language; Action Research; Banks,"['Building Block Based Modeling, Business Process Management, Mobile Application, Modeling Tools, Prototype']",en
4499162,An Ontology-Based Natural Language Service Discovery Engine – Design and Expermiental Evaluation,"Around the globe, we are witnessing a transition from a primarily goods-based to a service-based economy. At the same time, advances in information technology provide significant opportunities for the electronic provisioning of services via the internet. As a result, more and more services are being traded online. Just as search tools are indispensable to discover information or goods on the web, they will become vital for discovering services on the web. In this paper we present Themis-S, a prototype of an ontology-based natural language service discovery engine. In a series of experiments, we evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of Themis-S in comparison to other state-of-the-art information retrieval models. The experiments indicate that Themis-S, incorporating WordNet as a general purpose ontology, can outperform systems applying syntactic information retrieval models such as the Vector Space Model (VSM) or the Probabilistic Relevance Model (PRM).",service discovery; ontology; information retrieval; experiment,,en

E-Government, which has been a buzzword for all kinds of computer usage in the governmental context for several years, has started to become an ordinary way for public administrations to organise their work. Document and workflow management systems as well as process reorganisation in the backend and electronic taxation systems or digital ID cards on the frontend side all belong to the portfolio of concepts summarised by e-Government. However, in spite of the advantages that go along with these developments, adoption of e-Government services is still rather low both on the citizens' side as well as by the employees of public administrations. We conducted a literature review identifying the factors that influence the acceptance of e-Government services by different stakeholders and provide a framework of future research needs.","['Acceptance', 'Adoption', 'E-Government', 'Literature review']","['Activity-Oriented Sustainability', ' Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM)', ' Method Engineering', ' Electric Vehicle Domain', ' Green IS']",en

A Generic Approach Based on Set Operations ,"Searching for patterns in conceptual models is useful for a number of purposes, for example revealing syntactical errors, model comparison, and identification of business process improvement potentials. In this contribution, we introduce a formal approach for the specification and matching of structural patterns in conceptual models. Unlike existing approaches, we do not focus on a certain application problem or a specific modelling language. Instead, our approach is generic making it applicable for any pattern matching purpose and most conceptual modelling languages. In order to build sets representing structural model patterns, we define formal operations based on set theory, which can be applied to arbitrary models represented by sets. The basic sets represent the model elements, which in turn originate from the modelling language specification&rsquo;s instances. Besides a conceptual and formal specification of our approach, we present particular application examples and a prototypical modelling tool showing its general applicability.",,,en

Fast changing demands require varying information in varying places. Users must find relevant information in a fast and perspicuous way. Thus, information systems both have to be flexible and clearly structured to fulfill these requirements and be able to handle the increasing amount of information efficiently. WWW-based information systems provide flexibility as they separate content, layout and navigation. However, several conceptual shortcomings prevent the Web from being a more productive and efficient resource of information today. Several technical enhancements (e.g. the semantic web) have been made in order to solve these problems. However, a theoretically proved and easy to use modeling method for WWW-based information systems is still missing. Our modeling method allows modeling these information systems on a conceptual level by abstracting from technical details. By this, meaningful navigation structures can be achieved with great clarity. In this paper we will develop this method using a meta-model based approach.",,,en

Research on the evaluation and selection of technologies has mainly adopted a process perspective so far. We argue that it is crucial to consider the inner structure of technologies as well and describe its elements and connections. Hence, in this paper we propose a framework for analyzing information technology by reconstructing its inner structure. We transfer concepts of philosophical Structuralism to technologies by analyzing the striking proximity in the assembly of theories and technologies as conceptual networks. By describing technologies in such a way, we are able to formulate a set of questions which allows for analyzing and evaluating the suitability of technologies for specific requirements. In order to demonstrate the utility of such theoretizied technologies we apply our approach to the technology .NET.","['IT artifact', 'Structuralism', 'Technology', 'Technology management', 'Theory nets']",,en

On the other hand, in many cases we can identify stagnation or decrease of financial resources available (section 1). This leads to a performance gap, which can also be found in the field of virtual town halls: public administrations&rsquo; websites, at current state, mainly provide informational and communicational services. Fully transactional services provide potential for real value added as well as cost reduction, but are seldom at the moment. Thus, we can identify a lacking financial support for virtual town halls; though virtual town-halls are a major factor for citizens&rsquo; and businesses&rsquo; perception of eGovernment service quality (section 1). Open Source Software (OSS) is in most cases free of cost and a valuable alternative to proprietary software products (section 2).Conceptual requirements specifications can help to support the development process of open source software applications for virtual town-halls we show how such OSS for virtual town-halls is applied in practice and what experiences have been made (section 3).",,"['Conceptual Modeling', ' Model Analysis', ' Pattern Matching', ' Naming Conventions']",en

Pricing value bundles constitutes a complex decision problem, since it requires the consideration of three perspectives: From the point of view of the provider, the available price corridor is limited downward by the costs for engineering, marketing and delivering a value bundle. From the customer's point of view, the upper limit of the price corridor is imposed by the expected customer value and corresponding willingness to pay. From a competitive perspective, the upper limit of the price corridor is marked by the price of a comparable competitor's offer. To provide companies with sound decision support, an integrated multi-perspective modelling language that accounts for all three perspectives simultaneously is presented. Based on the developed modelling language, an integrated decision support tool, i.e. the pricing workbench, has been designed.",,,en

As such, it makes use of the advantages of mobile websites – single code repository for software updates – and native apps – device-specific functionality. The app is integrated with the icebricks web application, so redundancies in the data management are avoided. The design of the app adheres to the previously compiled usability guidelines and ensures, amongst others, the same look-andfeel for both the web application and the mobile app. The app was shaped in a design thinking workshop with developers, BPM consultants, who are using the tool, and academic BPM and usability domain experts. The functional range of the app is a subset of the web application functionality and was worked out as part of the design thinking workshop.

4500932,Service Innovation Capability: Proposing a New Framework,"Service organizations face the challenge of offering their customers continuously improved or completely new services and, hence, require service innovations to sustain themselves in the market. We interpret the design and implementation of new or enhanced service offerings as a dynamic capability because the service organization is required to sense impulses for innovation, seize meaningful ways for change, and to finally transform its operational capabilities to the desired state. Accordingly, we propose a new framework which structures service innovation capability into the areas of sensing, seizing, and transformation. We further identify and describe the key activities in all of these three areas based on an analysis of existing literature. With this conceptual paper, we contribute to a better understanding of service innovation capability by proposing a novel framework which is grounded in dynamic capability theory. This framework is beneficial to both practice and academia. It offers an overview of service innovation capability areas and activities against which service organizations can critically reflect their service innovation initiatives. As for academia, it stipulates promising directions for future research. © 2011 Polish Info Processing Soc.",,,en

4502103,Product-Service System Approaches,"For some time, increasing importance is attached to services, both from an economical and a managerial perspective. First, the notion of ""service as basic unit of exchange"" emphasizes the application of specialized competencies for the benefit of someone else, while disregarding if a physical good or any other resource is used for exchanging value. Second, service-orientation allows enterprises to enter new markets by extending their existing portfolio of products by related services or realizing entire new offerings that are enabled by recent advances in information technology. Service description is a key challenge in developing and providing services to and with customers. Further it is a premise for coordinating several providers of an integrated customer solution. This chapter is an effort to explain how conceptual modeling can facilitate service description. We use Product-Service Systems (PSS) as an exemplary domain.We extract central concepts from several disciplines that are engaged in researching business aspects of PSS to develop a catalogue of modeling requirements to be accounted for in service description. Consecutively, these requirements are utilized to assess the current state of conceptual modeling languages for (product-related) service description.

It is described why an automated way of process analysis is necessary and why it is beneficial to use our approach. As business process models are moving in the center of decision making, it is important for the corresponding decision makers to get transparent, fast, and comprehensive results of process analysis. Dealing with huge amount of data this is only possible with automated support. Based on a comprehensive literature study, we identified different deviations and conflicts that usually arise in business process modeling projects. The class of semantic building block-based languages which combines structural modeling elements with corresponding domain semantics can help avoiding these conflicts. Beside the conceptual development of the language class we conducted an empirical evaluation of PICTURE, a business process modeling language that is an instantiation of semantic building block-based languages. Our results show that (a) our derived language class is applicable, (b) modeling conflicts significantly can be reduced, and (c) modeled data can be analyzed automatically.","['Business Process', 'Modeling Language', 'Domain Ontology', 'Domain Statement', 'Business Process Modeling']",,en

4503271,Towards A Reference Model for Online Research Maps,"Online research maps are websites that present information about certain research activities in a structured manner. Institutions like universities, states, or individual researchers use them as knowledge base to identify and communicate ""who knows what"" and ""where can the respective information be found"". Furthermore, these items are used as a research marketing measure, stressing the importance of this kind of portal. However, research maps differ in their range of functionalities, their respective naming, their target audience and so on. Thus, it is an exhausting task identifying and choosing the right set of functionalities. Our goal is to offer a template for the creation of common practice online research maps. For this purpose, we present a reference model and describe its development process. As preliminary measure, 66 research maps have been carefully analysed with respect to the formerly mentioned aspects. Derived from the results of our analysis, common practice was identified and used as basis for developing a reference model for online research maps. For development pur-poses, an existing language for describing internet portals was chosen and adapted to suite the requirements of describing research maps.

4503482,Maturity Models in IS Research,"Notwithstanding the relevance of maturity assessments in practice, Information Systems (IS) research has &ndash; despite exceptions &ndash; yet rarely endeavoured into reflecting and developing theoretically sound maturity models. This paper reports a literature review on maturity models in the IS domain. Specifically, it explores what type of research on maturity models has been undertaken (retrospection) and which potentially useful measures might be pursued in IS for future research (prospection). The paper suggests that research on maturity models is of growing interest; nevertheless, comparably few related articles have been published in the leading IS journals. We see that the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and its successor CMM Integration (CMMI) dominate studies of maturity. While maturity models have been addressed in prescriptive, descriptive and reflective works, the notions of maturity and maturity models have rarely been conceptualised in detail. In view of that, the paper presents implications for the practice of maturity model application and research thereof.",CMM; CMMI; Maturity; Maturity models; Literature review; IS research agenda,,en

4503621,Configurative Method Engineering - On the Applicability of Reference Modeling Mechanisms in Method Engineering,"The aim of this paper is to discuss the applicability of reference modeling adaptation mechanisms in method engineering. Reference models are generic conceptual models that formalize state-of-the-art knowledge of a certain domain. Adaptation mechanisms can assist to tailor reference models to specific business or project needs. (Situational) Method engineering is concerned with the preparation of methods that fit the characteristics of a situation. Due to the similar requirements, it seems feasible to investigate to what extent the existing mechanisms of reference modeling have already been reflected in the context of method engineering. The result of a literature review points out that the mechanism of configuration has not been sufficiently considered yet. We suggest transferring the concept of reference model configuration to the domain of method engineering. This approach is supported by an example case utilizing the H2 toolset in which a method is configured according to project specific needs.",Method engineering; situational method engineering; adaptive reference modeling; configuration; theories,"['E-Government', ' Public Administration', ' Process Landscape', ' ICT', ' Investment', ' Decision Support']",en

Here, we seek to investigate into the shared services phenomenon in the context of government reforms. For this purpose, an interview and document analysis-based multiple case study has been conducted in Germany. The qualitative analysis covers three shared service implementations on the local government level and identifies important preconditions for shared service emergence, namely cost pressure as motive, the existence of key actors promoting the topic and the existence of prior cooperation. Moreover, it is shown that the structure of such previous cooperation determines, if shared services are being organised in a centralised (shared service centre) or decentralised format (shared service network).","['E-Government', 'Networks', 'Public Sector Reform', 'Qualitative Study', 'Shared Services']",,

4504440,Applying Theory-Building Techniques to the Design of Modeling Languages,"In their 2004 paper Hevner et. al proposed a set of guidelines for conducting design science research projects in the IS discipline. While useful, these guidelines have a relatively high level of abstraction. However, various IT artifacts such as models, methods, techniques and implementations require IS researchers to apply differing methods in order to construct and evaluate purposeful artifacts respectively. In this paper we discuss a particular class of IT artifacts: conceptual modeling languages. As constituent parts of software development methods, a multitude of such languages has been proposed and discussed. Yet, in the related literature on method design only little guidance is provided on how to derive appropriate conceptual modeling languages from empirical data. We believe that &ldquo;good methods&rdquo; need to be rigorously grounded in empirical findings. Taking a look at the related literature on inductive theory building reveals that at there are prominent similarities between the elements that constitute theories and those that constitute conceptual modeling languages: whereas theories comprise of constructs and relationships between these, conceptual modeling languages comprise of language constructs and relationships among these. We draw from the body of literature on grounded theory building and propose a new approach to designing conceptual modeling languages.",Method Engineering; Conceptual Modeling Language; Theory Building; Grounded Theory Method,,en

Until today, the analysis part of a BPM cycle is mostly done manually. Process modelling methods are not designed to allow for automated analysis. Our aim is to show that meaningful weakness patterns that support semi-automatic analysis of business process diagrams (BPD) can be defined when a semantically enhanced modelling method is used. We derive exemplary weakness patterns by analysing literature and interviews from a business process redesign project. These are applied to a set of process models, in which occurrences of these weaknesses are being searched automatically. A comparison of achieved and expected results indicates that our approach helps to identify weaknesses within the processes and therefore supports business process analysis endeavours.","['(Semi-)automated weakness detection', 'Business process analysis', 'Semantic business process management', 'Weakness patterns']",,en

4504718,Fostering the Virtualization of Service Processes and Touch Points – Identification and Documentation of E-Service Potential in Retail Networks ,"Offering business services is widely considered a means for superior value creation. Increasing research activities in the emerging disciplines of Service Sciences and Service Science Management and Engineering (SSME) can be ascertained. Even so, the integration of service processes and their virtualization with suitable IT artifacts is seldom focused in SSME. Building on the Process Virtualization Theory (PVT), we propose ways to assess and document the eligibility of service processes and-on a more detailed level-of the activities that need to be virtualized among the stakeholders. On a process level, central questions are derived from the PVT. On an activity level, an extended service blueprinting notation is derived and conceptualized in a language-oriented meta model. We demonstrate the usability of our approach with an exemplary service process from the retail sector. Since the retail sector is quite mature, the concepts to be used there might also be reused in other service settings.",,,en

We provide a solution to this problem and propose a conceptual specification of a generic portal structure that allows for semantic standardization of content. The structure and semantics of textual descriptions must be customized for given application scenarios, so we demonstrate such a customization for an exemplary research portal. In the example we address design science research and describe a research process that uses the customized portal definition. We conclude that our approach can increase the consistency and comparability of content in general through (1) an individually customizable system structure that reflects the nature of a specific application scenario better than generic structures can and (2) a semantic standardization of textual descriptions that forces the portal users to be precise and compact in their descriptions and to consistently apply the vocabulary of the domain.","['Textual Description', 'Content Management', 'Design Science', 'Semantic Standardization', 'Content Management System']","['Value Bundle', ' Product', ' Service', ' Modeling', ' Configuration', ' Calculation', ' Service Science', ' SSME']",en

The PICTURE modelling method has been proposed as a way to efficiently model the whole process landscape of a public administration. Based on the processes captured, the impact of certain ICT functionalities can be analyzed. ICT investment decisions become more transparent towards the political leadership which are the decision makers in the public sector. This paper has two research objectives: First, an architecture for an semi-automated evaluation of ICT investment decisions is introduced.

4505542,Total Cost of Service Life - Decision Support for Selecting and Orchestrating Services,"Business services as well as information services (such as web services) can be described and discovered by means of their functional and non-functional properties. An important non-functional property is the price associated with consuming a service. On electronic marketplaces, evaluating the price of utilizing a service is often difficult due to a huge variety of existing pricing models and deliberately intransparent conditions of use. Even so, a sound evaluation of the total cost associated with a service is beneficial for a service consumer, especially in scenarios of long-term utilization of the service or if orchestrating services provided by different sellers. Theory and practice so far lacks methods that can sufficiently guide decisions related to selecting services based on cost data. This paper strives to present such a method based on the TCO concept and on insights from capital budgeting and investment theory. The method supports service customers in comparing the costs associated with several functionally similar services, in selecting services, and finally in evaluating the costs associated with entire service orchestrations.",Information services; Electronic marketplace; Service selection; Service orchestration; Cost calculation,,en

In the second part of the paper we investigate and summarize the rich set of empirical findings in the BWW Ontology domain. Lastly, we show how these theoretical findings can inform method engineering research. Including theory in method engineering has two advantages: Firstly, it is possible to predict the success or failure of the design and secondly, theory-driven design instantiates existing hypotheses and allows testing them.",BWW Ontology; Conceptual Modeling; Method Engineering; Design Science,"['Architecture', ' Complex event processing', ' Business process management', ' Business activity monitoring']",en

However, not all people have equal access or skills to use such services. As banks are interested in migrating customers online, they need to reveal the conditions of internet banking services acceptance and use. The main objective of this study is to understand the factors influencing internet banking adoption taking into account insights from the digital divide theory. In order to explain internet banking usage we developed a research model drawing from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Digital Divide research. Moreover, a qualitative pre-study has led to the creation of a new construct: perceived security. The model was tested against comprehensive survey data (n = 503). As a result, more than 90% of the variance of internet banking usage was explained by the elaborated model. Results demonstrate that the strongest factor influencing the intention to adopt internet banking services is the degree to which an individual believes that it is safe to use such services. Hence, this paper contributes to existing technology acceptance literature by introducing the construct of perceived security. Other major implications for theory and practice are discussed.",Internet Banking; Digital Divide; UTAUT; Quantitative Study,,en

4506774,Towards Business Process Modeling in Business Contracting – Analyzing Collaboration Contracts as a Field of Application for Process Models,Today's rising quantity of business collaborations increases the relevance of business contracting between companies. This leads at the same time to more complex and incomprehensible business contracts. We state a need for new approaches to handle this complexity. Business process modeling is a well established methodology of business process management (BPM) that can be used to handle complexity in business processes. In this paper we argue that conceptual models can improve comprehensibility of complex contracts by modeling those parts of business contracts that regulate specific procedures. Based on a contract analysis we indentify different contract content types and their potential for process modeling. The results show great potential in some content types and less in others. Based on our findings we propose the design of a software-based recommendation tool that could facilitate business contract design and the comprehensibility of these contracts.,business process modeling; contract design; collaboration contract,"['Dienstleistungen', ' Produktivität', ' Benchmarking', ' Facility Management']",en

Here, we show how a CMM for the structured conceptual design of management information systems has been developed in an evolutionary process based on meta modeling. The aim of management information systems is to satisfy the information need managers have to successfully accomplish their tasks. The quality of management decisions is highly dependent on the information they are based on. A structured conceptual design of management information systems is a crucial task that has to precede their implementation and monitoring. Several conceptual modeling methods have been developed in order to support the specification of data warehouse structures and management information systems. However, none of them was found to be appropriate to bridge the communication gap in the process of requirements analysis. Thus, in an ongoing research effort, a CMM has been designed to adequately support the conceptual design of management information systems. ' Several case studies were conducted and in an iterative process the findings were incorporated to improve the initial CMM. The result of this process is a CMM quite different to the original one. The aim of this paper is to elaborate on the evolutionary development of a CMM using meta modeling and to show how it has successfully been applied in multiple case studies.",,,en

Attribution is used &ndash; beside the layers of abstraction &ndash; as means to reduce the complexity of the models by shifting information to analyzable and easily maintainable attributes instead of sophisticated control flows within the process elements. The glossary is inspired by the idea of model conventions.

However, in service productivity measurement and managerial science in general, little attention seems to be paid on replicating empirical studies.

4508227,Business Process Management Capabilities in Local Governments: A Multi-Method Study,"Business Process Management (BPM) is a topic of greatest relevance to government innovation. While the concept originally stems from the private sector, public sector organizations have established BPM capabilities and are in the move of developing these further. Despite the importance of the phenomenon, literature does however not yet provide a comprehensive picture of BPM capabilities in governments. In this paper, we thus examine BPM capabilities on the local government level by means of an intertwined quantitative survey and (representative) qualitative in-depth case study. We identify a set of BPM challenges and reflect on the power of prevalent BPM capability assessment and development models, mostly maturity models, to provide good guidance. We suggest taking into account organizational positions in order to overcome the significant shortcoming of the 'maturity' concept, especially the focus on convergence towards an ""ideal"" state. Thus, we argue for developmental models following divergence theories. Implications for practice and potentially fruitful avenues for future research are discussed in the light of our findings. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","['Business process management', 'Developmental models', 'Public sector']","['Conceptual modeling, Consensus-oriented approach, Epistemological assumptions, IS development, IS research']",en
4508296,The Potential of Configurative Reference Modeling for Business to Government Reporting – A Modeling Technique and its Evaluation,"The steady increase of information requirements imposed by governments and authorities has led to more and more regulations for both firms and governmental organizations. Business to Government (BtG) reporting summarizes all the tasks that are necessary to create legally required reports for the governments. Along with the steady increase of reporting regulations, we have observed a growing effort to manage data warehouses and reporting infrastructures. The overall goal of this paper is to develop a modeling technique that (a) is capable of managing regulatory report requirements, (b) can be used for the development of configurative reference models, and (c) increases the effectiveness and efficiency of conceptual data warehouse design.<br /><br />We demonstrate its usability by applying it to a constructed financial services case using the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Two modeling experiments with Information Systems (IS) master‟s students provide evidence that configurative reference models applied to BtG reporting have a high probability of reducing data warehouse management effort.",Regulation; Reporting; Configurative Reference Modeling; Conceptual Modeling; Data Warehouse Engineering,"['Conceptual modeling, Consensus-oriented approach, Epistemological assumptions, IS development, IS research']",en

Existing modeling notations like BPMN or EPC are not able to cover the requirements induced by the volumes of such process model collections (PMC). The modeling technique proposed in this work addresses these requirements and enables organizations to efficiently manage their respective PMC. In fact, the proposed notation based on process building blocks allows for the efficient handling of PMC of any size. Its integrated structure of building block based process models combined with the concepts of layers, attributes, glossaries, reference models, and variants makes it a universal yet semantically standardized process modeling technique. The conceptual definition of the modeling technique and a prototypical instantiation and implementation are introduced. The practical applicability of the technique is justified through an evaluation in practice.",Business Process Management; Process Modeling; Process Model Collections,"['IT-Consulting', ' Project Management', ' Design Science Research', ' ERP Implementation', ' Governance Theory']",en

4508501,Reorganizing Public Administrations - How to manage Process Oriented eGovernment Projects,"The application of procedure models in project planning has evolved into a well-established tool not only in the field of software development but also regarding organizational design. Depending on the domain where such procedure models are applied, they have to be specified in detail and adapted to the business context. A common task in eGovernment projects for example is the selection of business processes for reorganization. A special characteristic in this domain is the existence of more than 1000 core processes. Hence it makes sense to use a structured procedure model for the pre-selection of processes for reorganization. Therefore this article provides such a procedure model and its application in a local government reorganization project located in the northern German region &ldquo;Muensterland&rdquo;. An empirical study was conducted in all 70 local governments in Muensterland. The results show the need for reorganization from an internal perspective and the potential for reorganization of about 50 citizen services from an external perspective. These services with reorganization potential were then analyzed with the help of the presented procedure model. The goal of our article is to present the theoretical background of the procedure model and how to apply it in concrete practical projects.",eGovernment; Process Management; Re-engineering; Empirical Study,"['data warehousing', ' requirements definition', ' meta modeling', ' reference modeling', ' management of model alternatives', ' configuration', ' multi-perspective framework']",en

4508641,Does Your Business Process Management (Still) Fit the Market? – A Dynamic Capability Perspective on BPM Strategy Development,"Business Process Management (BPM) can be viewed as a set of techniques to integrate, build, and reconfigure an organization‟s business processes for the purpose achieving a fit with the market environment. While business processes are rather stable in low-dynamic markets, the frequency, quality, and importance of business process change amplifies with an increase in environmental dynamics. Taking the public sector example, we recognize that market dynamics can change over time (market dynamic shift), here: increase. We show that existing designs of BPM might not be able to cope with the mounting frequency and quality of business process change (market-BPM-misfit). On the basis of a qualitative in-depth case study, we provide evidence that a major cause for such misfit lies in ineffective (second order) organizational learning. We contribute to the literature by applying the Resource-Based View and Dynamic Capability framework to the case of BPM in order to better understand shifts in market dynamics and their consequences for BPM effectiveness. Practitioners find a proposal for identifying, understanding, and reacting to a market-BPM-misfit and for developing market-oriented BPM strategy.","['BPM Strategy', 'Business Process Management', 'Dynamic Capabilities', 'Resource-Based View']","['E-inclusion', ' information society', ' e-Government', ' inclusive ICT design', ' digital divide']",en

4508782,On the Transition from Computation Independent to Platform Independent Models,"The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) describes software development based on models on different levels of abstraction. The development process is outlined as a sequence of model transformations which add specific details to the software models with each subsequent step. The OMG MDA guide refers to the computation independent model (CIM) as the highest level of abstraction. It can therefore be considered as the designated means for analysis in MDA software development projects. However, this model type is disregarded by most MDA methodologies and tools, which start their transformation process on the level of platform independent software models (PIM). This paper investigates the role and nature of the CIM, especially focussing on development processes for management information systems. We argue that an automatic translation from CIM to PIM is theoretically not feasible. To provide evidence for our claim, we evaluate existing transformational approaches that address the transition from models as real world perceptions to software designs. Lastly, we support our arguments by extending the traditional software development view by decision theory aspects during the design phase.","['Analysis', 'Computation independent model', 'Conceptual modelling', 'Design', 'Model driven architecture', 'Model transformation', 'Platform independent model']",,en

The objective of this paper is to develop an approach for measuring the distance between Business Processes Models (BPM) based on the behavior of the business process only while abstracting from any structural aspects of the actual model. Furthermore, the measure allows for assigning more weight to parts of a process which are executed more frequently and can thus be considered as more important. This is achieved by defining a probability distribution on the behavior allowing the computation of distance metrics from the field of statistics.",,"['Egovernment, Einclusion, Esociety, Technology adoption']",en

4509393,"The Generic Model Query Language GMQL – Conceptual Specification, Implementation, and Runtime Evaluation
","The generic model query language GMQL is designed to query collections of conceptual models created in arbitrary graph-based modelling languages. Querying conceptual models means searching for particular model subgraphs that comply with a predefined pattern query. Such a query specifies the structural and semantic properties of the model fragment to be returned. In this paper, we derive requirements for a generic model query language from the literature and formally specify the language's syntax and semantics. We conduct an analysis of GMQL׳s theoretical and practical runtime performance concluding that it returns query results within satisfactory time. Given its generic nature, GMQL contributes to a broad range of different model analysis scenarios ranging from business process compliance management to model translation and business process weakness detection. As GMQL returns results with acceptable runtime performance, it can be used to query large collections of hundreds or thousands of conceptual models containing not only process models, but also data models or organizational charts. In this paper, we furthermore evaluate GMQL against the backdrop of existing query approaches thereby carving out its advantages and limitations as well as pointing toward future research.",Business Process Management; Conceptual model repository; Conceptual model analysis; Generic model query language; Model querying,,en

In this paper, we design a predictive modeling technique that can be used to quantify probabilities of how a running process instance will behave based on the events that have been observed so far. To this end, we study the field of grammatical inference and identify suitable probabilistic modeling techniques for event log data. After tailoring one of these techniques to the domain of business process management, we derive a learning algorithm. By combining our predictive model with an established process discovery technique, we are able to visualize the significant parts of predictive models in form of Petri nets. A preliminary evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",Data mining; process mining; grammatical inference; predictive modeling,,en

The results provide evidence that the scholarly IS discipline is still much concerned with itself, for instance, in terms of its identity, relevance, foundational theory, or methodological pluralism - suggesting that the old debate on IS identity is not yet overcome. It thus cannot be claimed that the study identifies the grand challenges of the discipline - still it becomes noticeable that the academic community sees potentials for the IS discipline to have societal impact. A total of 21 challenges are identified, of which six challenges are categorized as ""meta challenges for further developing the IS discipline"" and the remaining 15 challenges are categorized as ""IS research challenges"" pertaining to socio-technical systems, IS infrastructures, society and ecology, as well as social well-being and affectivity. We provide a ranking of all challenges according to their relevance, potential impact, and possible time frame of realization. The results have some important implications for IS as a discipline as well as its prospective future societal role.

To tackle these two issues, we have built and evaluated a collaborative filtering recommender system which (a) makes individualized recommendations of potentially interesting value-added services when customers express interest in a particular physical product and also (b) leverages estimations of a customer's willingness to pay to allow for a dynamic pricing of those services and the incorporation of profitability considerations into the recommendation process. The recommender system is based on an adapted conjoint analysis method combined with a stepwise componential segmentation algorithm to collect individualized preference and willingness-to-pay data. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, our system requires significantly less customer input before making a recommendation, does not suffer from the usual sparseness of data and cold-start problems of collaborative filtering systems, and, as is shown in an empirical evaluation with a sample of 428 customers in the machine tool market, does not diminish the predictive accuracy of the recommendations offered.",Collaborative filtering; Dynamic pricing; Willingness-to-pay; Service science; Design science,,en

4512058,Service Productivity Management – Status Quo and Directions for the Design of Conceptual Modeling Grammars.,"The emergence and proliferation of the service economy greatly amplifies the need to thoroughly manage service productivity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expressiveness of conceptual modeling grammars for service productivity management as well as to provide directions for future research. Based on authoritative theories on service productivity, we identify a set of evaluation criteria with which we benchmark a selection of conceptual modeling grammars. Our analysis yields two major insights: First, literature on service productivity provides only limited theoretical support for designing conceptual modeling grammars. Second, the concepts contained in service productivity theories have found little recognition in the grammars&rsquo; meta models. We derive two core implications: First, extended theory support is needed to inform the design of conceptual modeling grammars. Second, additional constructs need to be included in conceptual modeling grammars to facilitate productivity-oriented analysis and design in the service sector.",Conceptual Modeling; Meta Model; Modeling Grammars; Service Productivity; Service Science,,en
4512127,Fast Pattern Matching in Conceptual Models – Evaluating and Extending a Generic Approach,"Identifying structural patterns in conceptual models serves a variety of purposes ranging from model comparison to model integration and exploration. Although there are a multitude of different approaches for particular modelling languages and application scenarios, the modelling community lacks an integrated approach suitable for conceptual models of arbitrary languages and domains. Therefore, a generic set-theory based pattern matching approach has recently been developed. To prove that this approach is beneficial in terms of performance, we conduct a statistically rigorous analysis of its runtime behaviour. We augment the original approach to include a caching mechanism that further increases performance. We are able to show that the original algorithm is able to identify arbitrary patterns within milliseconds. The caching extension further increases performance by up to fifty per cent given the model base and patterns we used.",,,en
4512199,Merging Conceptual Modeling and Law for Legally Compliant Information Systems Design – A Framework-Based Research Agenda,"Legal regulations play an important role in the design of information systems and their related organizational systems. A legal assessment subsequent to the system's development can demand expensive modifications or even the need for replacing existing systems. Legal infringements and resulting disputes can permanently damage an organizations image. To avoid these problems, we argue for the consideration of relevant legal regulations as early as the design phase of systems development. Conceptual modeling has proven to be an optimal instrument for system designers. In this paper, we propose a framework-based research agenda for the improvement of conceptual modeling for the explication and communication of legal requirements. We then show exemplary how the framework can be used by researchers to classify existing research results or to derive new research questions in the field of designing legally compliant information systems.",legal visualisation; conceptual modeling; research framework; information systems design,,en

To facilitate the exchange of thoughts, opinions, and beliefs about the IS development process and its objectives, the development group constructs representation forms of the object system.

4512952,Ontology-Driven Method Engineering for Information Systems Development,"Information systems development has to deal with evolving technologies and changing environments. Therefore, the engineering of methods as the problem of creating suitable instruments for new situations is critical to information systems development. The failure of IS development projects shows that method engineering is an open field. The question is if and how research on ontology can contribute to overcome the curren t situation. We show, based on linguistic and philosophical findings, how ontology can be used as linchpin in method engineering. We found that the language critique approach of Kamlah and Lorenzen (1984) provides the means to create ontologies by linguistic actions and that ontologies are always related to language communities sharing the knowledge of using a common language in communication processes. We present an ontology-driven engineering method for information systems development. Our method helps to create required language constructs to handle new situations. The ontology-driven engineering method is demonstrated using an elaborate example case. © 2005, Idea Group Inc.",,,

Such properties are either functional or non-functional. Amongst the non-functional properties is the price for service consumption. Evaluating the price of a service is difficult due to a huge variety of existing pricing models and conditions. But still, it is important to a service consumer to evaluate arising costs, esp. in scenarios of long-term usage and if combining several services. In theory and practice so far there exists no method that sufficiently guides the decision of selecting specific services regarding the non-functional property price. This paper strives to promote research-in-progress for such a method, which is based on the TCO concept and on insights from capital budgeting in investment theory. The method is indented to support service consumers in selecting a specific service, in comparing several functionally similar services, and finally in evaluating complete service orchestrations.","['Service Selection', 'Service Orchestration', 'Cost Calculation']",,en

Business documents constitute mutual agreements, often legally binding between business partners. Already existing document standards reduce the efforts of implementing data exchange. However, the specific properties of an organization entail a need for adaptation. We show that available reuse approaches do not support this appropriately. Context-based modeling is proposed based on the reuse mechanisms aggregation, restriction, and specialization. Context-based modeling aims at both, minimal preparation of reuse combined with a high degree of guidance to create suitable models. The proposal is conceptually explored and practically applied to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the approach.",Meta modeling; conceptual modeling; component-based development; reuse; business documents,,en

Our argumentation is grounded on the assumption that process modelling projects of a practically relevant size involve multiple modellers. Current modelling languages and methods, however, do only provide little support for such distributed modelling scenarios. Simultaneously, the conflicts that can arise in distributed process modelling projects are hardly discussed in the scientific literature. Therefore, this paper aims for two research results: Firstly, based on a formal framework an overview about the main conflicts of distributed process modelling is given. Secondly, a literature review is performed to identify possible solutions for these problems. Based on this the characteristics of an integrated approach are described. Formal modelling and deductive reasoning are applied as research methodology.",Distributed Modelling; Process Modelling; Modelling Conflicts; PICTURE,"['E-government, E-inclusion, Information society, Technology adoption']",en

4514377,Epistemological Perspectives on IS Research - A Framework for Analyzing and Systematizing Epistemological Assumptions,"Over the last three decades, a methodological pluralism has developed within information systems (IS) research. Various disciplines and many research communities as well, contribute to this discussion. However, working on the same research topic or studying the same phenomenon does not necessarily ensure mutual understanding. Especially within this multidisciplinary and international context, the epistemological assumptions made by different researchers may vary fundamentally. These assumptions exert a substantial impact on how concepts like validity, reliability, quality and rigour of research are understood. Thus, the extensive publication of epistemological assumptions is, in effect, almost mandatory. Hence, the aim of this paper is to develop an epistemological framework which can be used for systematically analysing the epistemological assumptions in IS research. Rather than attempting to identify and classify IS research paradigms, this research aims at a comprehensive discussion of epistemology within the context of IS. It seeks to contribute to building the basis for identifying similarities as well as differences between distinct IS approaches and methods. In order to demonstrate the epistemological framework, the consensus-oriented interpretivist approach to conceptual modelling is used as an example. © 2007 Blackwell publishing Ltd.",Epistemological Perspectives,,

The quality and thus the validation of conceptual models are of high economic importance. However, only little empirical work has focused on their evaluation so far. This raises the question whether a holistic approach to determining the quality of conceptual models is available yet. In order to describe the current state of research and to expose the so far neglected research fields we develop a two dimensional framework. With the help of this framework we can identify a notable shortcoming on conceptual model evaluation. We can show that there is actually no approach that covers all aspects of the framework. Hence, we describe a procedure model that integrates different evaluation techniques. This procedure model provides a starting point to further elaborate on a holistic evaluation approach.",,,en
4514717,Case Study Perspectives on Design Science Research,"An intensive discussion on research methodology can be observed in the information systems (IS) discipline. Especially design science research has recently gained much attention. According to March & Smith (1995), IS research consists of behavioral science research ('problem understanding paradigm') and design science research ('problem solving paradigm') (March & Smith, 1995; see also Hevner et al., 2004; Jani, 2001). In order to facilitate the evaluation of design science research efforts, Hevner et al. (2004) proposed a set of guidelines which was heavily adopted since. However, the interpretation of these design science research guidelines very much depends on the research methods and data collection technique applied. As a consequence, central issues in using design science research guidelines can be defined in more detail with regard to specific research methods. Hence, we seek to elaborate this argument taking the stance of case study research in order to reflect on design science research guidelines. © The Authors 2008.","['Case study research', 'Design science research', 'Research methodology']","['Article master data, Couponing, Data quality, Promotion, Retail']",en

Based on the knowledge captured with those process models, the impact of certain ICT functionalities on the processes can be analyzed. ICT investment decisions become more transparent towards the political leadership.

Not only master data management but also the automation of promotion processes at the point of sale, e.g. with coupons, can greatly benefit from data which can be analysed automatically and maintained in a collaborative effort. We propose a hierarchical concept for handling article master data by analysing the demands on this data with respect to promotion campaigns. Based on that, we present the architecture and implementation of a promotion platform which utilises this concept to structure articles in retail and to support promotion campaigns more consistently and flexibly than traditional approaches can.","['Article master data', 'Couponing', 'Data quality', 'Promotion', 'Retail']","['Risk communication', ' negative information', ' trust', ' human images', ' competence', ' benevolence', ' integrity']",en

Data warehouse designers are forced to work in interdisciplinary teams consisting of accountants and legal experts in order to meet the regulatory requirements. In this paper, we present a teaching concept that simulates a realistic data warehouse development scenario in financial service industries. By applying this teaching concept, students learn how to design compliant data warehouse systems. Implicitly students experience the challenges of interdisciplinary data warehouse engineering teams and conceptual (reference) modeling. The didactical concept, which is based on learning levels, sensitizes students for the usefulness and applicability of conceptual (reference) modeling and was positively evaluated in two elective courses.",IS Education; Teaching; Data Warehouse; Reporting; Regulation; Conceptual Modeling,"['information systems engineering', ' conceptual modeling', ' conceptual model analysis', ' model query', ' query language', ' graph search']",en
4516899,Conceptual Modeling of Electronic Content and Documents in ECM Systems Design: Results from a Modeling Project at Hoval,"The implementation of enterprise content management (ECM) software requires careful analysis of an organization's content and document assets, and conceptual information models can provide substantial input for ECM systems design. In particular, content models can support the documentation of both organizational and technological conditions and can illuminate software-related requirements. Therefore, a conceptual modeling language for electronic content and documents has to meet several conditions: It should facilitate description of how content can be reused in different documents, the creators and users of content, and the software systems involved. In addition, given the vast number of digital assets created and used in today's organizations, such a language has to safeguard a clear and consistent representation while also being ready for efficient adaptation and maintenance. With the help of the general criteria of conceptual modeling proposed by Becker et al. (e.g., correctness, relevance, clarity), this chapter identifies these and related requirements and argues that they are not sufficiently met by existing modeling approaches. As a response, we propose a novel modeling language that we developed and evaluated during the course of a modeling project at Hoval, to be used in describing electronic content and documents.",Conceptual Modeling; Content; Content Model; Content Specification; Enterprise Content Management (ECM); Enterprise Content Modeling Language (ECML); Modeling Language,"['business process modeling', ' business process compliance management', ' business process compliance checking', ' regulation', ' legal requirements']",en
4516970,An Efficient Business Process Compliance Checking Approach,"Assuring compliant business processes is an important task of business process management, which is commonly supported by the use of business process models. As every compliance rule corresponds with a typical structure, the detection of those corresponds to a pattern matching problem. More specifically, we encounter the problem of subgraph isomorphism. In this paper we propose an automatic business process compliance checking approach that relies on a subgraph isomorphism algorithm and that is suitable for process models in general. As common subgraph isomorphism is a problem that can only be solved in exponential time, we use an algorithm that simplifies the problem through pre-processing. This makes the isomorphism solvable in polynomial time. With the approach, we aim at supporting decision makers in business process compliance management.","['Business Process Management', 'Compliance', 'Efficiency', 'Pattern Matching', 'Subgraph Isomorphism']",,en

4517454,BPM Capability Development - A Matter of Contingencies,"Purpose - Business process management (BPM) is a key concept in information systems (IS) research that helps to connect business strategy with the use of technology in an organization. Contemporary BPM research is no longer only about methods, procedures, or tools for managing or modeling processes but about assessing and developing BPM capability in organizations. For this purpose, a vast collection of maturity models has been designed by practitioners and scholars alike. Such models are used to assess the status quo and benchmark it against other organizations, and, most important, to guide the development of BPM capability. With this study, the paper challenges the maturity model perspective of such development models. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, methods of qualitative IS research are employed to address the research objectives. Findings - The paper shows that maturity model-based guidance would be inadequate. Instead, other concept-external factors resulting from organizational and environmental characteristics appear to be important indicators. The theory discussion introduces alternative takes on BPM capability development, lays out implications for BPM practice, and presents potentially fruitful paths for future research in the area of BPM capability development. Originality/value - This paper challenges the current perspectives and contributes a new direction for conceptualizing BPM capability development.",Contingency theory; Capability development; Case study; Dynamic capabilities; Business process management; Maturity model,,en
4517523,Designing Interaction Routines in Service Networks: A Modularity and Social Construction-Based Approach,"Service networks made up of manufacturers and service firms to satisfy complex customer needs are proliferating. By exploiting their complementary competencies, such service networks enable their members to provide innovative and integrated solutions thatcould not be offered by any of the firms alone. The successful formation and operation ofservice networks requires the analysis and (re-)design of interaction routines that facilitateplanning and coordination based on a mutual exchange of information. We argue thatconceptual models are artifacts that enable networked organizations to improve how wellthey manage these interaction routines. Against this backdrop, this article makes four majorcontributions. First, a conceptual modelling language based on the design principle ofmodular decomposition of network complexity is developed for specifying interaction routinesin service networks. Second, a workshop-based modeling method based on the designprinciple of social construction of networks is developed for the purpose of guiding the(re-)design process itself. Third, the developed language and method are embedded into asoftware tool, and the utility of this ensemble artifact is demonstrated and evaluated usingcases of service networks in the construction industry. Fourth, a set of evaluation criteria isproposed for the purpose of assessing tool-supported conceptual modeling workshops andfor evaluating other types of conceptual workshops.",Interaction routines; service networks; modular design; social construction; business process management; conceptual modeling,,en

Moreover, the perceived social distance to CC providers can increase risk perceptions. Thus, gaining users' trust is a key challenge for CC providers. The results of our online experiment confirm that the intention to use CC services is highly dependent on a user's assessment of a provider's trustworthiness. We show that embedding two different assistive website elements (Search Box and Social Recommendation Agent) into CC providers' Service-Level Agreements and privacy policies positively influences the perceived trustworthiness of a CC provider by reducing perceived Information Overload and increasing perceived Control as well as Social Presence. Thus, besides improving security, CC providers not only have to communicate trust-critical information but also have to facilitate the search process for that information in order to be perceived as trustworthy.",Trust; cloud computing; information overload; social presence; social recommendation agent; search box; assistive website elements; service-level agreements; privacy policies,,en

a Generic Pattern Matching Approach for Conceptual Models in the Financial Sector","Given the strong increase in regulatory requirements for business processes the management of business pro&shy;cess compliance becomes a more and more regarded field in IS research. Several methods have been developed to support compliance checking of conceptual models. However, their focus on distinct modeling languages and mostly linear (i.e., predecessor-successor related) compliance rules may hinder widespread adoption and application in practice. Furthermore, hardly any of them has been evaluated in a real-world setting. We address this issue by applying a generic pattern matching approach for conceptual models to business process compliance checking in the financial sector. It consists of a model query language, a search algorithm and a corresponding modelling tool prototype. It is (1) applicable for all graph-based conceptual modeling languages and (2) for different kinds of compliance rules. Furthermore, based on an applicability check, we (3) evaluate the approach in a financial industry project setting against its relevance for decision support of audit and compliance management tasks.",Conceptual Modeling; Business Process Modeling; Business Process Compliance Management; Model Checking; Model Querying; Pattern Matching; Compliance Checking,,en

Together they constitute the so called Share Economy. These services often operate in a legal gray area. The relationship between the law and SCCS is bidirectional. On the one hand, the development of new SCCS offerings has to comply with a broad body of existing regulations. On the other hand, new P2P SCCS businesses often discover legislative loopholes, thereby forcing the law to react.This article conceptualizes the complex relationship between the law and IT-enabled P2P SCCS by means of a framework. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated by analyzing a specific SCCS in the electric vehicle charging infrastructure domain. The framework should constitute an effective tool in the design of new and legal P2P SCCS offerings.",service; peer-to-peer; sharing and collaborative consumption; law; relationship; share economy,"['Business process management, Domain-specific process modelling, Framework, Modelling language development']",en

4518005,"All Citizens Are the Same, Aren’t They? – Developing an E-government User Typology","Taking a closer look at current research on e-government diffusion shows that most studies or conceptual works deal with citizens as one broad mass that is not further described or divided into smaller subgroups. Such efforts are mainly limited to the digital divide discourse and distinguish at most between haves and have-nots or younger and older parts of the population. Understanding why and how citizens use public online services also requires an understanding of how different segments of the population react to IT in general as well as to e-government in particular. To date, no meaningful attempts to develop such an e-government user typology have been undertaken. Therefore, the study at hand aims at developing a user typology for the e-government context. To this end, we chose an explorative design and conducted a qualitative interview study in Germany in 2016 with 18 respondents from all age groups. We qualitatively analyzed the sample regarding usage behavior, variety of use, and e-government specific uses and perceptions. Our research reveals six user types differing in quality and quantity of use with regard to internet-based technologies in general and e-government services in particular. Understanding how different populations perceive e-government and contextualizing their behavior can help explaining why some citizens are making advanced use of e-government while others widely ignore these services.",e-government; citizen; qualitative research; user types,"['Egovernment, Government, Innovation, Innovation capabilities, Open innovation, Social media affordances']",en

Insufficient communication of implemented data privacy and data security measures may lead to a lack of trust. Visualizations are known to have various beneficial effects when used to communicate information. This paper investigates whether providing visualizations as means for communicating data privacy and security measures has a positive effect on trust. A laboratory experiment was conducted to measure the effect of visualizations on trust in the provider, trust in the measures of the provider, and on information security and privacy concerns. The results indicate that there is a small positive effect regarding trust in the provider and in his measures and no significant effect regarding information security and privacy concerns. The findings provide first insights into the effect of visualizations on trust and lead to several further research questions. © 2014 IEEE.",,"['business process modeling', ' process similarity', ' process comparability', ' glossary', ' semantic standardization', ' usability']",en

The purpose of this study is to explore how successfully local governments utilise SNSs for managing their external communication with citizens. Using a multi-method analysis of 15,941 posts and 19,290 comments on the Facebook pages of the 25 largest German cities, we make five contributions to research and practice. First, we analyse the properties and topics of government posts to draw a rich picture of how local governments use Facebook as a communications channel. Second, we conceptualise success in governments' online communications in terms of the frequency and polarity of citizens' reactions, which we use for third, evaluating government communication behaviour in SNSs. Fourth, we identify which benefits SNSs offer that traditional communication channels do not provide.

The probabilistic modelling approach is carefully designed to deliver comprehensible results that can be visualized. Thus, domain experts can judge the predictive models by comparing the visualizations to their experience. Model analysis techniques can be applied if visualizations are too complex to be understood entirely.

While the risks associated with cloud services are hardly communicated on cloud providers' websites, previous research on risk communication shows that being honest and creating more transparency by communicating negative information helps providers in being perceived as more credible and trustworthy. The results of our online experiment show that communicating additional negative information besides positive information increases the perceived integrity of a cloud provider. Moreover, when communication is framed as stemming from an IT Manager, perceived competence and integrity of the provider may further be increased. The results of our study indicate that communication of online risks is an important field of study. In contrast to shiny websites, we recommend a more honest communication with potential cloud users.

To analyze conceptual models structurally and semantically, so-called model query languages have been put forth. Model query languages take a model pattern and conceptual models as input and return all subsections of the models that match this pattern. Existing model query languages typically focus on a single modeling language and/or application area (such as analysis of execution semantics of process models), are restricted in their expressive power of representing model structures, and/or abstain from graphical pattern specification. As the mentioned restrictions may hamper query languages to propagate into practice, we aim to close this gap by proposing a modeling language-spanning structural model query language based on flexible graph search, hence providing high structural expressive power. To address ease-of-use, it allows diagramed specification of model queries. In this article, we present the syntax and the semantics of the diagramed model query language (DMQL), a corresponding search algorithm, an implementation as a modeling tool prototype, and a performance evaluation.",information systems engineering; conceptual modeling; conceptual model analysis; model query; query language; graph search,,en

4519114,Towards an EPC Standardization – A Literature Review on Exchange Formats for EPC Models,"Event-driven process chains (EPCs) have been used to create business process models from the early 90s and are still used in research and practice today. However, up to today, there is still no accepted standard for the EPC modelling language, which caused several different EPC dialects to appear and disappear over the last decades. To contribute to the development of a future standard for the EPC modelling language, we have conducted a systematic literature review on exchange formats for EPC models. In the paper at hand, we describe seven different exchange and storage formats which we have found in literature and compare their properties and capabilities. We find that the EPC Markup Language (EPML) has the greatest capabilities so far, as it supports the greatest variety of different EPC dialects. With our discussion, we contribute to the development of an EPC standard in the future, by describing how EPML can be adapted as a standardized exchange language for EPC models, which is part of a future standard for the EPC language.",,,en

The paper identifies concepts for supporting model understandability in BPM, provides an overview of methods implementing these concepts, and discusses the methods' applicability in cBPM. The four concepts process model transformation, process model visualization, process model description, and modeling support are introduced. Subsequently, 69 methods are classified and discussed in the context of cBPM. Results contribute to revealing existing academic voids and can guide practitioners in cBPM scenarios.",Business Process Management; Collaborative Business Process Management; Model Understandability; Literature Review,,en

It is demonstrated that the framework satisfies the identified requirements by structuring and systematizing the development of domain-specific languages, which increases language adequacy and quality.","['Business process management', 'Domain-specific process modelling', 'Framework', 'Modelling language development']","['Consensus-Oriented Approach, Epistemology, Ontology, Reference Framework, Simulation']",en
4519887,Design and Implementation of a Toolkit for the Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Tweets,"The microblogging service Twitter is a lively social media channel where people report on almost everything imaginable. Using tweets to analyze consumers' opinions about individual products and services is a valuable source of information used by brands and companies to learn about their public perception. We present an aspect-based sentiment analysis approach for extracting positive, negative, and neutral aspects from tweets by leveraging part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing from natural language processing. The approach manifests in the design of a software toolkit that facilitates the sentiment analysis, starting from the extraction of tweets, filtering, over the automated analysis, up to the interactive display of the results. By applying dependency patterns between nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and negotiations to the individual sentences, the toolkit identifies aspects and sentiment expressions, for which the polarities are determined subsequently. We demonstrate the developed solution by looking at the case of Airbnb, where people can rent out their homes to others over a Web platform. It is important to note that Airbnb only provides the platform and has little influence on the actual lodging service. Thus, looking at word-of-mouth regarding individual service experiences yields evidence of praise and criticism, which can help to seize improvement potential.","['Data Analytics', 'Microblogging', 'Sentiment Analysis Toolkit', 'Sharing Economy', 'Twitter']",,en

To consider all these regulations is a challenging task for organizations whch handle regulative complexity in mfferent ways. Until now, the influence of the degree of regulation on the organization of MIS received only little attention in IS research. Ths paper introduces a theoretical model and research design that enables investigating the influence of regulation on the organization and success of MIS. The presented model is based on the contingency theory.","['Compliance', 'Contingency Theory', 'MIS', 'Model', 'Organizational Effects', 'Regulation', 'Success Factors']",,en
4520092,Where are the participants? Including motivational aspects into theorizing and design in IS Research,"The purpose of this paper is to identify new research prospects for the information systems discipline, based on establishing a link to the body of knowledge in the fields of work psychology and organizational psychology. Since information systems are work systems consisting of information, technologies, and participants, who are supported by information and communication technology (IT), productivity is a function of human performance. Job demands and individual resources in IT-supported work environments should therefore be considered in order to facilitate employee motivation, prevent strain, and cope with the challenges related to an ageing workforce and a high prevalence of burnout in the IT sector. As an initial literature review shows, these research vistas are underrepresented in previous information systems research. The present paper proposes directions for including job demands and individual resources into the analysis, design and operation of IT-supported work environments from two angles. First, the benefits of including psychological theories in typical phases of a business process management project are discussed. Secondly, the contributions of extending five types of information systems theories for the discipline in general are outlined.","['Burnout', 'Business process management', 'Information system', 'Job demands-resources model', 'Strain', 'Work motivation', 'Work system']",,en
4520160,"Towards Increased Comparability of Business Process Models - Design, Implementation and Evaluation of Semantic Standardization Functionality","Business Process Management (BPM) has become a widespread practice in organizations. Companies use business process models to document their internal processes for training purposes, optimization, certification or requirements specification. However, as the modeling projects are often carried out by distributed teams of BPM experts, the resulting models may suffer from naming variability conflicts. Variability makes the created models difficult to understand, to automatically analyze and to re-use. In order to avoid these pitfalls, modeling guidelines, such as use of domain-specific glossary and verb-object phrase structures for element labels, were suggested. However, methodological and tool support is rarely provided. Moreover, no effectiveness studies of semantic standardization functionality were yet conducted. We close this research gap by presenting a strategy for the implementation of semantic standardization functionality and put particular attention on the evaluation of its implementation. As a result of the evaluation, we highlight design decisions, which have an effect on the comparability of process models. The study is of interest to both, academics and practitioners, who work in the area of process modeling and intend to increase process model comparability.",business process modeling; process similarity; process comparability; glossary; semantic standardization; usability,,en

While there is a well-defined standard for BPMN, such a standard is missing for EPC. As a standard would be beneficial to improve interoperability among different vendors, this paper aims at providing the means for future EPC standardization. Therefore, we have conducted a structured literature review of the most common EPC variants in IS research. We provide a structured overview of the evolution of different EPC variants, describe means and capabilities and elaborate different criteria for decision-making in regard to including EPC variants in a standardization process.",event-driven process chain; EPC; process modelling; literature review; EPC variants; EPC dialects; exchange formats; EPC evolution; standardisation,,en
4520303,On the de-facto Standard of Event-driven Process Chains: Reviewing EPC Implementations in Process Modelling Tools ,"Nowadays, most process modelling tools implement popular modelling languages such as the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) or the Event-driven Process Chain (EPC). However, in contrast to BPMN, no effort has yet been undertaken to standardize the EPC language, thus rendering EPCs as being merely a de-facto standard for business process modelling. Subsequently, this paper addresses this issue by laying ground for a successful EPC standardization. To achieve this task, several process modelling tools have been evaluated regarding their implementation of the EPC language with the objective to derive consensus about important language constructs. The evaluation reveals that there is a high degree of variety in the way tools implement EPCs. Especially syntax, semantic and pragmatic of the EPC language are not perceived homogenously and, in fact, commonly neglected. Hence, our research provides valuable implications for further EPC standardization by highlighting the state-of-the-art of the EPC from a software point of view.",Event-driven Process Chain; EPC; Business Process Management; BPM; standardization; modelling tools; tool evaluation,,en

4520449,Business Development in the Sharing Economy: A Business Model Generation Framework,"Recent success stories such as those of Airbnb or Uber have proved that the Sharing Economy has evolved from a niche phenomenon to an independent economic sector. Against this backdrop, it is widely recognized that business models - although a research field still based on a highly-fragmented body of knowledge - constitute one of the most important factors to create such success stories. By leveraging the extant literature, a framework for business model generation is proposed, which is specifically tailored to the domain of the Sharing Economy. Hence, this work's contribution is multifaceted: Literature is synthesized to cope with the current fragmentation and used to study state-of-the-art business model (generation) approaches. Furthermore, shortcomings in the application of current business model (generation) frameworks with regard to the Sharing Economy are pointed out. The merit of this research is the presentation of a consolidated framework for business model conceptualization and generation in the Sharing Economy.","['Business Model', 'Business Model Development Framework', 'Sharing Economy']","['Process Modeling', ' Municipal Public Administrations', ' Brazil']",en

The relationship between the economic sciences and information quality has been the subject of much of the work recognized through the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Beginning with Simon's decision-making model published before a discipline known as Information Systems existed, this paper reviews this relationship and the parallel development of information quality and computing capability from an Information System perspective and changing paradigms in economics as recognized in the works of the Nobel laureates. From economic theories based on assumed knowledge, the paradigm is shifting to methods of empirical testing and experimentation. Organizations continue to make operational and strategic decisions. Additionally, now information is being aggregated, warehoused, mined, and analyzed to make a host of societal decisions and to understand economic behaviors through experimentation and empirical analysis.","['Data quality', 'Master data', 'Ontology', 'Retail', 'Semantic']",,en

4521274,Leaving the Beaten Tracks in Creative Work – A Design Theory for Systems that Support Convergent and Divergent Thinking,"Existing knowledge is a vital prerequisite for creativity. It provides a central source of inspiration for new ideas and determines the pathways available for creative problem solving. Notwithstanding its indisputable role, knowledge may also compromise creativity. The human mind is prone to reproduce what it is used to, and the provision of explicit knowledge constitutes a potential inhibitor of imagination. Hence, IT systems supporting creative work have to support creative individuals by extending their personal knowledge while, at the same time, preventing them from merely walking down beaten tracks. In this article, grounded in theory on human cognition and literature on creativity support, we propose a design theory for IT systems that support both convergent and divergent thinking, that is, the central cognitive processes in creative work. We provide details on a prototypical implementation, discuss an illustrative case from the creative industries in order to demonstrate the design's applicability, and outline plans for an empirical evaluation of the proposed design theory.",creative work; knowledge management; convergent and divergent thinking,"['Conceptual Modeling', ' Content', ' Content Model', ' Content Specification', ' Enterprise Content Management (ECM)', ' Enterprise Content Modeling Language (ECML)', ' Modeling Language']",en
4521341,Discussion of Functional Design Options for Online Rating Systems: A State-of-the-Art Analysis,"Ratings are important for building up trust among different parties. Since the arrival of the internet era in the 1990s, countless online rating systems have emerged. For example, Amazon.com established a rating system for books and other products in 1995. Today online rating can be found everywhere, be it e-commerce sites, social networks, and information or recommendation platforms. In most cases, users provide the input to these systems which is then aggregated and directed to appropriate recipients. The increasing relevance of these rating systems forms a new distinct research field with a growing need for research on the design, effects, and validity of rating systems. Hence, we contribute to the body of knowledge by conducting a thorough analysis of the state of the art of online rating systems. We especially focus on the functional design options by analyzing 102 different systems with the help of a criteria catalog of 237 criteria. In this paper, we discuss an excerpt of our findings and present a morphological box that categorizes functional design options for online rating systems.",E-Commerce; Reputation; Web 2.0; User Participation,,en

Is the subject of creativity-despite its undisputable importance for individuals, organizations, and societies-still a neglected area in IS research? In what contexts, with what methods, and with what results have IS researchers studied the phenomenon of creativity? And what creativity-related themes warrant further investigation? In this article we analyze, based on six analytical dimensions, IS studies on creativity published in the eight top-ranked IS journals as recommended by the Association for Information Systems. The analysis provides a detailed picture of how the concept of creativity has been treated in our discipline's arguably most influential publication outlets. It becomes apparent that IS researchers have been predominantly employing a rather limited number of research designs aiming at a rather limited number of creativity-related topics. Grounded in our analysis, we discuss the prospects of creativity research in the IS discipline and provide a future research agenda. In doing so, we propose three main research themes that can meaningfully contribute to our discipline. © 2010 by the authors.","['Creativity', 'IS research', 'Literature analysis']","['Business Intelligence', ' In-Memory', ' Big data']",

4522574,Toward Process Modeling in Creative Domains,"Process modeling has emerged as a widely accepted approach in order to reduce organizational complexity in organizations. Process models are used for different purposes, including process analysis and redesign, risk management, and the implementation of software systems. However, the majority of existent approaches is restricted to processes that are wellstructured and predictable. Highly creative environments, such as the film industry or R&D departments, however, are characterized by high levels of flexibility. As existent approaches do not provide ample means to model such processes, this paper discusses the capabilities that a conceptual process modeling grammar for processes in creative environments must provide. Furthermore, we suggest an approach to process analysis that aims at the identification and specification of creativity in business processes. The study belongs to the design science paradigm; the discussion is grounded in a theory that explains the nature of processes that rely on creativity.","['Business process management', 'Creativity', 'Creativity-intensive process', 'Design science', 'Modeling language']","['Design Science', ' Service Science', ' IT Artifacts', ' Germany', ' Hybrid Value Creation', ' Customer Solutions', ' Product-Service Systems']",en

For instance, they can warn decision-makers about undesirable events that are likely to happen in the future, giving the decision-makers an opportunity to intervene. The topic is gaining momentum in process mining, a field of research that has traditionally developed tools to discover business process models from datasets of past process behavior. Predictive modeling techniques are built on top of process-discovery algorithms. As these algorithms describe business process behavior using models of formal languages (e.g., Petri nets), strong language biases are necessary in order to generate models with the limited amounts of data included in the dataset. Naturally, corresponding predictive modeling techniques reflect these biases. Based on theory from grammatical inference, a field of research that is concerned with inducing language models, we design a new predictive modeling technique based on weaker biases. Fitting a probabilistic model to a dataset of past behavior makes it possible to predict how currently running process instances will behave in the future. To clarify how this technique works and to facilitate its adoption, we also design a way to visualize the probabilistic models. We assess the technique's effectiveness in an experimental evaluation with synthetic and real-world data.",Process Mining; Process Discovery; Business Process Intelligence; Grammatical Inference; Predictive Modeling,,en

Offering value bundles (consisting of services and physical goods) takes place in integrated product-service systems, spanning the coordinated design and delivery of services and physical goods for customers. Conceptual Modeling is an established approach to support and guide such efforts. Using a framework for the design and delivery of value bundles as an analytical lens, this paper evaluates the current support of reference models and modeling languages for setting up conceptual models for an integrated design and delivery of value bundles. Consecutively, designing modeling languages and reference models to fit the requirements of conceptual models in product-service systems are presented as upcoming challenges in Service Research. To guide further research, first steps are proposed by exemplarily integrating reference models and modeling languages stemming from the service and manufacturing domains.","['Conceptual modeling', 'Modeling language', 'Product-service system', 'Reference model', 'Value bundle']","['Meta modeling', ' conceptual modeling', ' component-based', ' development', ' reuse', ' context']",en

We conduct a focus group study in the software development industry, collecting qualitative data on creativity-specific tool properties of OctoProz: playfulness, comprehension, specialization, and collaboration. The results show that task-specificity of the tool was highly appreciated by the business modeling experts, while improvements are needed with regards to playful interaction with the business model and support of comprehension of the business model. Real-time collaboration in the modeling process over-satisfies the experts&rsquo; needs. Our findings contribute to the purposeful design of business modeling tools. Further, the results suggest that the components for collaborative idea development are valid, while aspects of GUI design and collaboration modes require further attention.

This paper presents a runtime analysis of four graph-theoretical algorithms for (frequent) pattern detection. We apply these algorithms to large collections of process and data models to demonstrate that, despite their theoretical intractability, they are able to return results within (milli-) seconds.

4524496,Design Science in Service Research: A Framework-Based Review of IT Artifacts in Germany,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the nature of IT artifacts that have been proposed in the emerging discipline of Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME) as well as to provide further directions for design research in the service discipline. We review a sample of 123 service-related IT artifacts - that we identified on a German online research portal - by coding them with a framework for design research in the service science discipline. The key insights derived from the analysis are: (1) methods dominate other artifact types; (2) instantiations are almost exclusively developed for supporting the potential dimension of services; (3) research on customer solutions focuses on an inside-out perspective; (4) new constructs are predominantly developed for modeling the outcome dimension of services; (5) artifacts often possess a narrow scope; and (6) artifacts are seldom instantiated into software tools. These novel insights are expected to guide future design research in the service discipline by identifying areas which have only been sparsely addressed by design research or are yet to evolve to a sufficient state of maturity. Our approach is original as it features an early and innovative endeavor for identifying the nature of IT artifacts in SSME.",Design Science; Service Science; IT Artifacts; Germany; Hybrid Value Creation; Customer Solutions; Product-Service Systems,"['Design Thinking, Dienstleistungen, Geschäftsmodelle, Innovation, Service']",en

4524850,Can We Afford Integrity by Proof-of-Work? Scenarios Inspired by the Bitcoin Currency,"Proof-of-Work (PoW), a well-known principle to ration resource access in client-server relations, is about to experience a renaissance as a mechanism to protect the integrity of a global state in distributed transaction systems under decentralized control. Most prominently, the Bitcoin cryptographic currency protocol leverages PoW to 1) prevent double spending and 2) establish scarcity, two essential properties of any electronic currency. This paper asks the important question whether this approach is generally viable. Citing actual data, it provides a first cut of an answer by estimating the resource requirements, in terms of operating cost and ecological footprint, of a suitably dimensioned PoW infrastructure and comparing them to three attack scenarios. The analysis is inspired by Bitcoin, but generalizes to potential successors, which fix Bitcoin&rsquo;s technical and economic teething troubles discussed in the literature.",Bitcoin; Proof-of-Work; IT security; Green IT,,en

Understanding the customers' point of view on value creation and integrating customers as co-creators of value into service processes are important research fields in Service Science Management and Engineering. At the same time, a lack of investigation of the providers' points of view on offering and fulfilling integrated value propositions can be ascertained. To compensate for this deficit, our paper investigates four different integrated value propositions in the B2B-market to study how an integration of service and manufacturing processes can be accomplished by sharing information in service systems. Based on in- depth business process analyses, information needsarising from the integration of service processes and manufacturing processes are identified and systematized in a conceptual framework. From a service research point of view, this framework provides a fundament to build on in consecutive qualitative and empirical investigations as well as for designing IT artifacts.",B2B market; Business process analyses; Information needs; Manufacturing business processes; Service management; Service systems,"['Interorganizational Standards', ' Management Cybernetics', ' Viable System Model', ' Model of Systemic Control', ' Standard Selection', ' Business Relationship Digitization']",en

4525058,Stakeholder Involvement in Business Process Management Agenda-Setting and Implementation,"Process management serves the design of IT and organizations, while multiple actors have stakes in setting the agenda and implementing process innovations. These stakeholders, from both inside and outside an organization‟s boundaries, constitute integral elements of a larger network of actors. The stimulation and utilization of such networks are critical success factors for process management and innovation initiatives. Without the inclusion of stakeholders, adaption of organizational processes to a dynamic environment can be expected to be less effective and less successful. Although the importance of process management networks and stakeholder inclusion is widely acknowledged in the literature, current research lacks a thorough empirically informed understanding of the phenomenon. Taking the public sector example, this paper sets out to study empirically the involvement of different stakeholders and to develop a theory for analysis of process management collaboration. We conduct a comprehensive quantitative survey of more than 350 organizations and apply principle component analysis to identify distinct sets of stakeholders. Empirical evidence is provided for collaborative patterns of internal actors, vertical collaboration partners, horizontal collaboration partners, political actors, commercial actors, and customers. These patterns can serve as generic theory constructs, building blocks, for future research on process management stakeholders and solving issue in research and practice regarding stakeholder involvement.","['Business process management', 'Collaboration', 'Empirical study', 'Networks', 'Stakeholder involvement']","['cloud computing', ' infrastructure as a service', ' technology acceptance', ' trust', ' communication']",de

4525617,Configurative Service Engineering – A Rule-Based Configuration Approach for Versatile Service Processes in Corrective Maintenance,"Recently, service orientation has increasingly been debated both in research and practice. While researchers postulate a paradigm shift towards services as the basic unit of exchange in economies, companies strive to efficiently provide a wide array of business services to their customers. To accomplish this, companies (a) are required to consciously design the services in their portfolio with respect to a structured engineering approach and (b) also have to flexibly adapt the engineered service processes to individual customer needs, wants, and demands. Hence, services shall be supplied efficiently and in consistent quality without sacrificing customization for customers. Supporting this mass-customization strategy for business services, we present a configurative service engineering approach. After engineering a configurable process model for business services, customized service processes can efficiently be derived from the model by applying configuration mechanisms. The process of configuration is aided by the software tool Adapt(X). We present the concept and tool support by applying them on business services for corrective maintenance in the mechanical engineering sector.",,,en
4525688,Business Process Governance: Theorizing and Empirical Application,"Studies by Gartner (2010) or McKinsey (2008) suggest univocally that improving business processes is the undisputednumber one priority for organizations world-wide. Hence, organizations need adequate capabilities for Business ProcessManagement (BPM). However, these capabilities do not necessarily need to be developed in the organization itself &ndash; aninclusion using other sourcing structures (e.g. cooperation/network or market instead of hierarchy) is possible as well. Thispaper builds upon an understanding of BPM as a dynamic capability and a well-known distinction of governance strategies(market, cooperation, hierarchy) to develop a business process governance framework. Using an extensive case study weinitially test this framework in a European PRODUCTION company. Therefore, we make the following contributions: 1)development of a BPM theory that integrates dynamic capability and governance theory, 2) a model for understandingsourcing strategies in BPM, and 3) empirically sound factors explaining sourcing strategies in BPM. Our results suggest thatorganizations facing a low dynamic market environment do not employ dedicated resources for business process change butrely on ad-hoc measures. Moreover, they gather these resources mostly internally (hierarchical governance). The paper endswith implications for both research and practice, limitations, and potential avenues for future research.","['BPM', 'business process governance', 'dynamic capabilities', 'governance theory']",,en

Numerous kernel theories have been utilized to inform CSS design principles. However, the logical next step for design research is pending: this rich field of research may now allow for more quantitative empirical research on the actual effects of particular CSS design features on creative performance. Against the background of this research gap, we first analyze existing CSS design theories applying an analysis framework encompassing obligatory design theory components. On that basis, we extract the underlying independent (latent) variables addressed in design principles. Our contribution entails a unified design theory for CSS, laying the basis for future research in IS design science on creativity-support. Furthermore, we reflect on our approach to develop a unified design theory and discuss its implications for the philosophy of design science. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","['Creativity Support Systems', 'Design Theory', 'Empirical Evaluation']","['Social Media Analysis', ' Business Model', ' Coding Scheme']",en

An Explanatory Information System Design Theory","Creativity is an important precondition of innovation. However, the management of creativity-intensive processes (CIPs) is beyond the scope of standard methodologies for business process standardization and automation because of the contradictory properties of CIPs, which require both process structure and creative freedom. We develop an explanatory design theory based on theoretical constructs from BPM theory, creativity research, and collaboration engineering, with the core component of an integrated IS architecture that facilitates the design of systems providing comprehensive support for CIPs. Automated control of structured processes and support of idea development in groups increase process efficiency and creative performance. Evaluation of a sub-portion of an expository instantiation (CreativeFlow) of the architecture in a laboratory experiment suggests that working with CreativeFlow leads to ideas that are more specific, while working without the tool generates ideas that are more feasible. Further, idea evaluation support of CreativeFlow must be improved in order to increase ideas' feasibility and relevance. The validity of our theory is derived from a deductive development approach.

4526374,Designing Trust in Websites - An Evaluation of Leading Infrastructure as a Service Providers’ Websites,"Cloud Computing (CC) is a computing paradigm that besides its positive outlook is also associated with risks and uncertainties. As a consequence, trust in CC providers is an important antecedent for CC adoption. Trust is a perception which is shaped by communication. From the perspective of CC providers, websites are a convenient way for contacting potential clients. Literature suggests applying trust-inducing features to websites in order to raise CC providers' trustworthiness. These trustinducing features are classified into three website design dimensions, namely visual, social cue and content design. The goal of our study is to analyze whether leading CC Providers make use of these design recommendations. We find that some website features are used by all CC providers while other website elements are used less frequently. Consequently, there is a need to investigate why certain website elements have not been adapted by CC providers. Moreover, there are differences in how providers embed trust-critical information such as technical information, or storage locations. By getting an impression about how cloud providers in practice design their websites with regard to trust this article may stimulate the discussion and further research on how trust can be created by CC providers via their websites.","['Cloud computing', 'Trust', 'Website design', 'Websites']","['Interorganisational standards', ' Self-Organisation', ' Adaptivity', ' Value creation networks', ' Autopoiesis']",en

The quality of management decisions is highly dependent on the information they are based on. A structured conception of these systems is a crucial task that has to precede their implementation and monitoring. Several conceptual modeling methods (CMM) for business intelligence applications have been developed in order to support the specification of data warehouse structures and management information systems. However, none of them was found to be appropriate to bridge the communication gap in the process of requirements analysis. Thus, in an ongoing research effort, a CMM has been designed to adequately support the system conception. Several case studies were conducted and in an iterative process the findings were incorporated to improve the initial CMM. The result of this process is a CMM quite different to the original one. The aim of this paper is to elaborate on the evolutionary development of a CMM and to show how it has successfully been applied in multiple case studies.",Management Information Systems; Method Engineering; Evolutionary Design; Conceptual Modeling; Design Science Research; Case Study,,en

4527471,Conceptual Modeling of Semantic Navigation Structures: The MoSeNa-Approach,"At the present time, several shortcomings prevent the more effective use and more intense application of web information systems. Recent developments that are subsumed by the term Semantic Web aim to solve these problems. The inherent idea behind these approaches is the annotation of data with metadata, in order to enhance automated processing and the use of ontologies to describe data semantically. However, the emergence of the Semantic Web raises new issues (e.g. significantly higher complexity) for web information system engineers. From an information system engineering perspective, conceptual modeling is an approach for dealing with high complexity and diversified project teams. On the one hand, conceptual models facilitate the (semi)automated generation of information systems. On the other, they foster communication between project team members and provide a sound basis for information system development. In this paper, we present an approach to modeling semantic navigation structures. This approach aims at modeling complex, role-based and integrated navigation structures for structured and semi-structured data. Since navigation via links is the only way for users to interact with the web information system and, to a large extent, determines their ability to retrieve the desired information, a proper definition of these navigation structures is essential for a successful web information system.

Studies revealed that one dollar investment in usability brings 10 times more profit than investments in advertising. Usability of web-sites and desktop applications has been extensively investigated during last decades. However, little was done in the area of usability of process modelling tools. We argue that generic usability measurement frameworks do not reflect the particularities of this kind of applications. In our work in progress paper we are conducting a number of empirical studies in order to find out environment dimensions and their effect on usability attributes.

In this context, many studies show that social presence, i.e. the feeling of human contact, has a positive effect on the formation of trust. However, the theoretical explanation of the relationship is still somewhat unexplored in the IS domain. In this study, we draw on psychology literature and derive a comprehensive framework to conceptualize and explain the relationship in detail. Particularly, we identify four mechanisms that were not yet explicated by IS research. Using the developed framework as a structuring device, we then carry out a structured literature review in the IS domain to identify existing studies and their theoretical focus as well as to point out research gaps. We are able to show that there is much more to the relationship between social presence and trust than the IS domain has yet recognized.",Social Presence; Social Cues; Online Trust; Literature Review,"['Airline, Consumer search behaviour, International analysis, Meta-search engines, Online travel agents, Panel data']",en

After developing a coding schema based on the business model, we conducted an in-depth analysis of 16 websites of companies that actively promote social media analysis to their clients. We identified three archetypes of business models in this area: specialist content analysts, social data and application integrator, and social media service provider. Future research can build on these insights in order to focus on designing or revising methods for social media analysis to realize either of these business models.

These languages specify a set of domain-specific concepts and assign diagrammatic representations to them. A considerable amount of work has been done to develop meta-modelling tools ensuring syntactical correctness of models created with DSMLs. However, little has been published about the challenges of developing a graphical model editor for meta-modelling tools. Specifying how conceptual elements of a DSML are to be represented graphically is often cumbersome. Moreover, tools are sometimes too inflexible to handle advanced features beyond displaying static icons. Furthermore, graphical representations must be kept consistent in case of reuse in multiple, potentially integrated DSMLs. This paper&rsquo;s aim is to carve out a set of requirements for graphical model editors as used in meta-modelling tools. We present a conceptual model considering these requirements.

Any brilliantly engineered software unable to suit the user's expectations will fail in practice. Tight time-to-market and limited resources makes acceptance testing difficult. This is especially true if multiple locations for development and testing are concerned. We argue that a solution must allow an off-site customer to test the software in question whenever he finds the time to do so. This requires tool support as well as simplicity in design. Within these constraints, we propose on a framework and elaborate on a prototypical software solution that facilitates distributed acceptance testing in Extreme Programming projects. We utilize technologies to allow the deployment over the internet even in strictly organized company networks. We provide further evidence of the feasibility by deploying the software prototype to evaluate the design.","['Acceptance tests', 'Agile IS development', 'Extreme programming']",,

It is described whether and why the semantic building block-based approach reduces the variations in distributed modeling projects in comparison to traditional modeling approaches. Our argumentation is grounded on the assumption that the specification of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) requires a detailed understanding of the intra- and interorganizational business processes. In order to enable the collaboration of services the underlying process structure must be explicated. In a laboratory experiment the variations of distributed process modeling in the traditional and the building block-based approach have been compared. It could be shown that the semantic building block-based approach leads to considerably fewer variations and, thus, to a more consistent view on the intra- and interorganizational process landscape.",,,en

Current literature in this field identifies maintaining a process-aware IT landscape and managing boundary-crossing relations as important functions in BPM. Regarding the former, we understand ""BPM range"" as the level of process-awareness in the IT landscape. As for the latter, we view ""BPM reach"" as the potential utilization of boundary-crossing relations. Based on these two dimensions, we propose a framework for exploring development paths in BPM implementations. This framework is then exemplarily applied in two case studies in the telephone and chemical industries. We are able to identify a development towards a higher level of BPM range in both industries while only the telecommunication company is looking to increase its BPM reach. Based on our empirical findings, we derive generalizable propositions for BPM development in both dimensions for future theory building efforts.",,,en

In our study, we propose online application as a use case for the eID in a university. In a quantitative survey with 1,632 students, we analyse the factors influencing a possible adoption of the eID by students. For this purpose, we extend the basic TAM by the variables perceived risk, social context, experiences, communication and demographics.

4529317,Comprehensive Tool Support for Enterprise Modeling and Evaluation,"Enterprise modelling and evaluating subsequently created models is manifold. Enterprise modelling means capturing an organization's business processes, its organizational structure, its corporate strategy, or its supporting information systems in graphical conceptual models. Evaluating these models means assuring their structural and semantic quality as well as their user group adequacy. Enterprise modelling and model evaluation requires comprehensive tool support. Recently, a number of modelling tools have been proposed each addressing particular aspects of enterprise modelling or model evaluation. For example, meta-modelling tools allow for defining new and altering existing modelling languages. Meta-modelling tools are thus well suited for enterprise modelling as this requires a large number of different modelling languages that may need to be adapted to the particular enterprise. In contrast, some modelling tools provide mechanisms to structurally or semantically evaluate models of a predefined language. However, comprehensive tool support for enterprise modelling and model evaluation is missing up to now. With this paper, we aim at closing this research gap by proposing a tool combining meta-modelling capabilities with features to structurally and semantically evaluate models as well as to manage model perspectives. The tool thus covers the entire model lifecycle from defining a problem-suitable modelling language, creating models, configuring them for different user groups, and evaluating them in terms of structure and semantics.",Enterprise Modelling; Meta-Modelling; Model Analysis; Model Configuration,"['Digital competence, Multi-case study, Small and medium-sized enterprises, Typology']",en

The availability of object-oriented features calls for the option to use objects as logic variables as well, as opposed to being limited to primitive type logic variables. The present work contributes a concept for reference type logic variables in constraint-logic object-oriented programming that takes arbitrary class hierarchies of programs written in object-oriented languages into account. The concept discusses interactions between constraint-logic object-oriented programs and reference type logic variables, particularly invocations on and access to logic variables, type operations, and equality. Furthermore, it proposes approaches as to how these interactions can be handled by a corresponding execution environment.","['Constraint-logic object-oriented programming', 'Free objects', 'Multi-paradigm languages', 'Object type constraints']",,en

On the other hand, current cross-platform approaches are usually limited to platforms for smartphones and tablets. The model-driven paradigm seems well suited for developing apps for novel and heterogeneous devices. However, one of the main challenges for establishing a model-driven framework for wearables consists of bridging the variety of user interfaces and considering different capabilities of device input and output. This paper seeks to investigate the challenges of app development for wearable devices regarding user interfaces and discusses a possible mapping of typical application building blocks in the domain of business apps. Ultimately, apps modelled on a task-oriented level of abstraction using platform-independent notations such as MAML or CTT can then be transformed into code that adopts device class specific representations.","['Business app', 'Cross-platform', 'Mobile app', 'Model-driven software development', 'Multi-platform', 'Wearables']","['Insider threat, Non-malicious security violation, Security policy, Workarounds']",en

The two-speed IT concept aims at harmonizing these vastly different requirements by decomposing the IT function into a traditional and an agile mode. While benefits of the concept are widely acknowledged in theory, little is known about its real-world application. Our study captures notions from a practitioners. Specifically, we want to elaborate how practitioners evaluate the concept against the backdrop of the challenges induced by digitalization.

Focusing on algorithm performance results of the COCO platform of several years, we construct a representative set of high-performing complementary solvers and present an algorithm selection model that, compared to the portfolio’s single best solver, on average requires less than half of the resources for solving a given problem. Therefore, there is a huge gain in efficiency compared to classical ensemble methods combined with an increased insight into problem characteristics and algorithm properties by using informative features. The model acts on the assumption that the function set of the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark is representative enough for practical applications. The model allows for selecting the best suited optimization algorithm within the considered set for unseen problems prior to the optimization itself based on a small sample of function evaluations. Note that such a sample can even be reused for the initial population of an evolutionary (optimization) algorithm so that even the feature costs become negligible.","['Automated algorithm selection', 'Black-box optimization', 'Exploratory landscape analysis', 'Machine learning', 'Single-objective continuous optimization']","['Knowledge sharing, Performativity, Perspective, Shared services center, Sociomaterial assemblages, Sociomaterial practice, Workarounds']",en

54104548,The role and impact of comparison websites on the consumer search process in the US and German airline markets,"The paper examines how consumers search for airline tickets based on a comparative analysis of the US and German markets. Data from comScore is analysed using an innovative application of set theory. ComScore is a leading commercial provider of business intelligence and consumer analytics based on its worldwide panel of two million online users. The search process is modelled using the concept of the consideration set based on primary search with the airline websites and secondly by the use of online travel agents and meta-search engines, which are termed comparison websites. Three generic search models are proposed: (1) primary search with airline websites only; (2) search of comparison websites only; (3) a combination of primary search and comparison websites. Each generic search model accounts for a significant proportion of overall users in both markets. The consideration sets are 2.58 in Germany and 2.74 in the United States. It is shown that the use of comparison websites significantly increases the propensity to conduct additional primary search based on analysis of all major airline pairs in both markets.

It shows how consumers’ decision-making styles and product knowledge define distinct archetypal behaviour that shapes online purchase processes and affects decision-related outcomes: satisfaction with choice; and satisfaction with process. The first study proposes a new modelling approach that creates an accurate representation of decision-making behaviour. Using this method, a clear structure that underlies seemingly chaotic purchase processes is identified. This structure offers an analytical tool capable of capturing behavioural differences between archetypes. The results show that decision-making style and product knowledge affect the structure and complexity of decision-making processes. The second study found that consumers with higher product knowledge are more satisfied with decision-making process and that this relationship is mediated by the duration of decision-making. Maximizers are more satisfied with their choice than satisficers, and this relationship is mediated by the number of alternatives that are evaluated.","['Consumer decision-making', 'Consumer satisfaction', 'Maximization tendency', 'Process modelling', 'Product knowledge', 'Purchase processes']",,en
54104704,eHealth Search Patterns: A Comparison of Private and Public Health Care Markets Using Online Panel Data,"Background: Patient and consumer access to eHealth information is of crucial importance because of its role in patient-centered medicine and to improve knowledge about general aspects of health and medical topics. Objectives: The objectives were to analyze and compare eHealth search patterns in a private (United States) and a public (United Kingdom) health care market. Methods: A new taxonomy of eHealth websites is proposed to organize the largest eHealth websites. An online measurement framework is developed that provides a precise and detailed measurement system. Online panel data are used to accurately track and analyze detailed search behavior across 100 of the largest eHealth websites in the US and UK health care markets. Results: The health, medical, and lifestyle categories account for approximately 90% of online activity, and e-pharmacies, social media, and professional categories account for the remaining 10% of online activity. Overall search penetration of eHealth websites is significantly higher in the private (United States) than the public market (United Kingdom). Almost twice the number of eHealth users in the private market have adopted online search in the health and lifestyle categories and also spend more time per website than those in the public market. The use of medical websites for specific conditions is almost identical in both markets. The allocation of search effort across categories is similar in both the markets. For all categories, the vast majority of eHealth users only access one website within each category. Those that conduct a search of two or more websites display very narrow search patterns. All users spend relatively little time on eHealth, that is, 3-7 minutes per website. Conclusions: The proposed online measurement framework exploits online panel data to provide a powerful and objective method of analyzing and exploring eHealth behavior. The private health care system does appear to have an influence on eHealth search behavior in terms of search penetration and time spent per website in the health and lifestyle categories. Two explanations are offered: (1) the personal incentive of medical costs in the private market incentivizes users to conduct online search; and (2) health care information is more easily accessible through health care professionals in the United Kingdom compared with the United States. However, the use of medical websites is almost identical, suggesting that patients interested in a specific condition have a motivation to search and evaluate health information, irrespective of the health care market. The relatively low level of search in terms of the number of websites accessed and the average time per website raise important questions about the actual level of patient informedness in both the markets.

In total, 144 platforms were analyzed using an online panel data methodology, which identified 32 leading SME e-commerce platforms in the UK and United States. These leading platforms were analyzed at the market level using cluster analysis based on strategic group theory and website content analysis. A taxonomy is proposed based on theoretical constructs derived from business model theory: value proposition, Web 2.0 sophistication, and revenue model. Five distinctive strategic groups are identified: information laggards, basic networking, advanced networking, advanced networking mature, and social media markets. The study further outlines managerial implications for SMEs, SME e-commerce platform providers, and external sponsors of the platforms—predominantly government organizations and banks.",,,en

54123962,Telemedicine Adoption by Different Groups of Physicians,"This study addresses the factors that could affect the intention of physicians to adopt telemedicine technology. Based on the theoretical foundations of technology adoption models, a revised model is proposed and tested via a questionnaire with two groups of physicians that were, at the time of the survey, just about to use telemedicine technology. Group A is composed of physicians from a large urban healthcare provider institution involved in clinical, teaching, and research activities, and will soon use a telemedicine intranet solution. Group B is composed of physicians from rural areas who will eventually be linked to a telemedicine network. Results analyzed with PLS indicate that in both cases, physicians' perception of usefulness of telemedicine is positively related to their intention to adopt this technology. This is the only common result between the two groups. Other significant yet different results indicate that the reactions of two types of potential adopters of telemedicine are influenced by their background and environment. This revised model helps in distinguishing the shades in the intention of adopting telemedicine between two distinct groups of physicians.","['Biomedical imaging', 'Birds', 'Costs', 'Education', 'Information technology', 'Medical diagnostic imaging', 'Medical services', 'Roads', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing']","['History, Social Representations Theory, WikiGen, Wikipedia']",en

54124112,The Dilemma of Integration versus Autonomy: Knowledge Sharing in Post-Merger IS Development,"Although research acknowledges the role of IS in a merger, it has not addressed the issue of boundary management during the development of ISs aimed at supporting merged organizations. Yet, it has been shown, albeit not in a merger context, that knowledge sharing during IS development involving agents from different communities is critical and difficult. Hence, our study addresses the questions of how agents from merging organizations, engaged in an IS development during post-merger integration (PMI) share knowledge of the work practices required by a specific PMI approach, and of how the resulting IS functionalities are affected by, or do affect the implementation of a PMI approach? Adopting a practice perspective, we aim at developing a theory on knowledge sharing in this context. To do so, we conduct a case study of three IS developments within a merger in the healthcare milieu.","['Individual characteristics/individual differences', 'Information system development', 'IS development', 'IS integration', 'Organizational change']","['Multi-Objective Optimization', ' Multimodality', ' Landscape Analysis', ' Hypervolume Gradient Ascent', ' Set Based Optimization']",en

We draw from the concept of organizational identity and on the literature on knowledge sharing across boundaries to analyze three information systems development (ISD) projects in a large teaching healthcare centre resulting from the merger of five hospitals. We propose a multilevel model that suggests that the interaction of organizational identity and cross-boundary knowledge sharing may result in information systems with final functionality different from planned functionality. The model also suggests that organizational-level decisional events, such as the choice of integration approach between the merging entities, may influence how new information systems are developed at a group level, and how those organizational-level events, in turn, are shaped by group-level events. © 2012 IEEE.",,"['Cold-start problem, Collaborative filtering, Recommender system, Social networks, User profile']",en
54124262,Too Much or Not Enough: Information Systems Integration in Post-Merger Context - A Sociomaterial Practice Perspective,"During the post-merger integration phase (PMI), new information systems (IS) that span the boundaries of the previously independent organizations need to be implemented to enable a specific level of integration. Although the literature emphasizes the important role played by ISs in support of the amalgamated organizations, there is a lack of studies on the issue of boundary management at the information technology (IT) level in a PMI context. We draw on a sociomaterial practice perspective to analyze two IS implementation projects in a healthcare organization resulting from a merger of previously independent hospitals. The results suggest there is a dilemma of post-merger IT integration versus autonomy, which is reflected by the unpredictability of the implementation's outcomes for the ISs designed to enable planned practices. The model also suggests that post-merger practices reflect the outcomes of dialectic processes of resistance to, and negotiation of, the IS configuration during its implementation. © 2012 IEEE.",,"['Electric vehicle charging, Peer-to-peer sharing and collaborative consumption, Sharing economy, Willingness to pay']",en

Although research stresses the importance of the two phases of the IOS integration, that is the systems development and the systems diffusion, there is a paucity of studies on the mechanisms underlying the integration process and their recursive relationships.

54124487,The Workarounds Process as a Source of Knowledge Creation and Management,"The dynamics of the actual global context create a growing need for creation of better knowledge management in organizations. More than ever global markets exercise a bottom-up pressure (market dynamics and daily practices) and a top-down pressure (standardization) on employees who must constantly create, acquire and disseminate new knowledge. Due to this, employees engage sometimes in workarounds that defy the standardization of expected performance. However, given that workarounds are deliberate actions in contrast with the prescribed practices, they are marginalized by organizations that perceive them as detrimental. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that is based on the idea that the integration of workarounds in the workplace represents a process of knowledge management. It also suggests that the use of a socio-technological tool that allows the building and sharing of workarounds by employees will help foster the creation and updating of knowledge in the organizational memory.","['Knowledge management', 'Modeling object types', 'Ontology web language', 'Workarounds theory']",,en

We draw on a practice perspective to analyze the spanning practices of boundary shakers - mandated change agents - as they attempt to engage with others in cross-boundary collaborative initiatives that aim at changes as part of the post-merger integration process. Our analysis suggests that some of the pre-merger practices were resilient at the end of the project. We suggest that one of the boundary shakers' practices of boundary consolidation through discourses of authoritative knowledge and 'group-making' facilitated the construction of symbolic boundaries between the merging parties, thus contributing to the resilience of pre-merger practices.","['Boundary consolidator', 'Boundary shaker', 'Change agent', 'Discursive strategy', 'Merger', 'Practice perspective', 'Symbolic discourse']","['Quantitative, Sabbaticals, Social information processing (SIP) theory, Structural equation modelling (SEM), Supervisor support, Theory of planned behaviour (TPB), Work-life balance (WLB) policies']",en

Despite the richness of the literature on IOR, less is known about the mechanisms that trigger and affect collaborative efforts during an IOR process. We adopt a qualitative and processual approach and draw on the concepts of assets orchestration mechanisms, surface structures and deep structures to propose a conceptual framework. We conjecture that the connection between surface structures and deep structures of the IOR process is facilitated by three specific mechanisms: allocating resources, structuring resources and coordinating resources. Our single case data analysis suggests that IOR efforts work well across organizational boundaries between business partners thanks to the assets orchestration mechanisms and when shared vision and artefacts are translated into shared processes and practices.",,"['Stream Clustering', ' Data Streams', ' Evolutionary Optimization', ' Machine Learning']",en

Workarounds may lead to information systems (IS) security policy violations, notably when prescribed practices lead employees to face obstacles in accomplishing their daily tasks. Such behavior generates new insider threats to IS security. In this article, we adopt the view that workarounds may enable the identification of new security threats.

Interculturality is conceptualized as the interaction between individuals and not just the cohabitation between various national cultures. We draw on the concepts of social regulation, which represents a process of social rule-making, and observational learning to propose a conceptual framework based on three research propositions that analyses the dynamic relationship between culture and intercultural learning accumulated via social regulation. In this context, we conjecture that interculturality in offshore virtual teams is not only expressed through electronic communication but also through the way of perception and execution of daily work tasks.

Although the literature stresses the growing adoption of the SSC as an outsourcing model, there is a lack of studies that examine shared services as a dynamic process of knowledge sharing across the organizational boundaries. We draw on a sociomaterial practice perspective and on the theory of workarounds to analyze an IS implementation project in a healthcare organization resulting from a merger of previously independent hospitals. The results suggest that new technology can be enacted in different ways as it links up with practices of different communities of users. We propose a multilevel process model that indicates at the end of the project a resulting mix of formal and informal (workarounds) practices that emerged from a dialectic process of resistance to, and negotiation of, the IS configuration during its implementation.","['Knowledge sharing', 'Performativity', 'Perspective', 'Shared services center', 'Sociomaterial assemblages', 'Sociomaterial practice', 'Workarounds']",,en

Drawing on the literatures on SSC and on cross-boundary knowledge sharing we propose a conceptual framework based on four research propositions that were validated with primary and secondary data. The results suggest that IT-SSCs present high human capital, but encounter challenges developing relational and structural capitals. It also appears that IT-SSC management tends to prefer the utilization of boundary spanners and boundary objects instead of boundary discourses and boundary practices as mechanisms for efficient boundary spanning.","['Boundary discourse', 'Boundary object', 'Boundary practice', 'Boundary spanner', 'Intellectual capital', 'Knowledge boundary spanning mechanism', 'Shared services centre']","['Business Intelligence', ' Inter-organizational Business Intelligence System', ' Inter-organizational Information Systems', ' Retail', ' Small and Medium Enterprises']",en

54125476,Exploring Collaboration Technology Use: How Users' Perceptions Twist and Amend Reality,"Purpose - This study aims to examine how a collaboration technology is used by three organizational groups. The main focus is on the interplay between the users’ perceptions (of the technology and of the knowledge shared) and the material properties of the collaboration technology. Design/methodology/approach - Two theoretical frameworks (social representations and sociomaterial practice perspective) examine collaboration technology use to better understand the underlying dynamics. The research is conducted as a case study in a US company where a collaboration technology was being implemented. Findings - The findings reveal a process model showing how social dynamics and users’ perceptions of what the collaboration technology can do and cannot do to share the users’ knowledge influence the users’ behaviour. Based on these perceptions, users will twist or amend their interpretation of the reality (the material properties of the technology) to justify their use of the collaboration technology. Research limitations/implications - This research is conducted as a single case study. However, the significant amount of time spent at the research site allowed for a very rich description of the events and processes involved. Practical implications - This study offers guidelines on what influences use and adoption of collaboration technologies. It highlights the importance of providing more than just training, as social dynamics and users’ perceptions continuously influence users’ behaviour. Originality/value - By combining two complementary theoretical frameworks, this study provides a novel and more in-depth explanation of collaboration technology use (or lack thereof).","['Case study', 'Collaboration', 'Information technology', 'Knowledge sharing', 'Social representation', 'Sociomateriality']","['Action design research, Joint research projects, New service development, Practice-oriented research, Service research']",en

CVDS has 30 employees and 5 stores with annual sales of around $CDN 5 million (2015). The case focuses on phase two, the ""Clicks,"" where an IT project, divided into two parallel subprojects, was realized: (1) the custom development of an ERP system, and (2) the creation of an online e-commerce. The project was based on an ""on-premises"" sourcing strategy where the information systems were developed ""in-house"" by external service providers. After several months of efforts, the subprojects were abandoned and CVDS' activities were rolled back to their legacy systems (Part A). Pulling the plug on the IT project was a tough decision for CVDS who still needed the online store to be implemented in order to support its stores' activities.

In both projects, the final IS-enabled practices differed from the post-merger practices that had been planned by the hospital management.

The term was initially only used for smartphones and tablets, but desktop software now is also referred to as apps. More important than the wording, however, is the trend towards app-enablement of many further kinds of devices such as smart TVs and wearables. App-enabled devices usually share some characteristics and developing apps is often similar. However, many complexities must be mastered: Device fragmentation and cross-platform app development already are challenging when only considering smartphones. When trying to grasp the field as a whole, app-enabled devices appear as a jungle: it becomes increasingly hard to get an overview. Devices might not be easy to categorize let alone to compare. Investigating similarities and differences is not straightforward, as the outer appearance might be deceiving, and technological peculiarities are often complex in nature. This article aims at mastering the jungle. For this purpose, we propose a taxonomy for app-enabled devices. It provides clear terms and facilitates precision when discussing devices.

54130467,Interoperability of BPMN and MAML for Model-Driven Development of Business Apps,"With process models widely used as means for documentation and monitoring of business activities, the conversion into executable software often still remains a manual and time-consuming task. The MAML framework was developed to ease the creation of mobile business apps by jointly modeling process, data, and user interface perspectives in a graphical, process-oriented model for subsequent code generation. However, this domain-specific notation cannot benefit from existing process knowledge which is often encoded in BPMN models. The purpose of this paper is to analyze conceptual differences between both notations from a software development perspective and provide a solution for interoperability through a model-to-model transformation. Therefore, workflow patterns identified in previous research are used to compare both notations. A conceptual mapping of supported concepts is presented and technically implemented using a QVT-O transformation to demonstrate an automated mapping between BPMN and MAML. Consequently, it is possible to simplify the automatic generation of mobile apps by reusing processes specified in BPMN.","['BPMN', 'Business app', 'Business process modeling', 'Mobile app', 'Model transformation']","['Encapsulated search, Java, Operational semantics, Programming paradigm integration']",en

An experimental analysis compares two MO algorithms, one that explicitly relies on hypervolume gradient approximation, and one that is based on local search, both on a selection of generated example problems. We do not focus on performance but on the interaction induced by the problems and algorithms, which can be described by means of specific characteristics explicitly designed for the multimodal MO setting.

Unfortunately, traditional collaborative filtering suffers from the so-called cold-start problem, which is the challenge to recommend items for an unknown user. In this paper, we introduce a generic framework for social collective recommendations targeting to support and complement traditional recommender systems to achieve better results. Our framework is composed of three modules, namely, a User Clustering module, a Representative module, and an Adaption module. The User Clustering module aims to find groups of users, the Representative module is responsible for determining a representative of each group, and the Adaption module handles new users and assigns them appropriately. By the composition of the framework, the cold-start problem is alleviated.","['Cold-start problem', 'Collaborative filtering', 'Recommender system', 'Social networks', 'User profile']","['IT/IS function', ' de-/centralization', ' IT/IS strategy', ' corporate-level strategy', ' business-level strategy']",en

Making privately owned charging points for electric vehicles accessible to the public in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) charging network may present a remedy to this problem. Developing such a P2P service, among others, requires knowledge on the customers' willingness to pay for EV charging. We survey customers of a utility company in a mid-sized European city to assess their willingness to pay for EV charging. Using choice-based conjoint analysis, we obtain customers' willingness to pay differentiated by charging point's characteristics and its location. The estimates are subsequently implemented in form of price recommendations into an actual web-based P2P platform that enables private individuals to provide and access EV charging services.

54164810,A Product Service System Configurator for Repurposing Used Electric Vehicle Batteries,"High initial costs are one of the major obstacles for the diffusion of electric vehicles (i.e., electric cars). The repurposing of used electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) is seen as a possibility to lower the total costs of ownership of the vehicles and therefore to foster electric car sales. However, the decision how to repurpose used EVBs requires severe information system (IS) support. In particular, in this article, the configuration task of providing used EVBs as product-service systems (PSSs), which would hardly be possible without IS support, is addressed. Configurators are a type of information systems that is suited to provide the required support. However, current instantiations of configurators for PSSs are scarce. An existing prototype is available but has certain limitations. Notably, it is only suitable for product-centric PSSs. Therefore, we set out to extend the configurator and present the design of a configurator that is capable of assisting the configuration of other types of PSSs (i.e., use-oriented and result-oriented). The configurator is instantiated and evaluated based on requirements derived from the literature and domain knowledge. While currently the configurator is specific for the domain of repurposing used EVBs it can be adapted to other domains.","['Decision support', 'Design science research', 'Product-service system', 'Second-life']","['Business Strategy', ' IT/IS Strategy', ' IT/IS Investment Planning', ' IT/IS Budget']",en
54170166,Leveraging Distributed Unit Test Case Execution for Java for Improving the Testing Process,"Software testing is a broad research field and of great relevance to practitioners. Software testing involves multiple consecutive testing phases. One of these phases is the unit-testing phase, during which individual requirements of the software component are checked. Only once software-units and -components have been tested, can the testing process continue. Trivially, if this phase requires a great amount time, the testing process is delayed and in the worst case, the rollout of the system has to be rescheduled. Focusing on the widely adopted JUnit test framework, a system was proposed to execute test cases on multiple distributed virtual machines. This paper evaluates the approach to distribute such test cases across multiple Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), leveraging container-based virtualization, by means of a prototype. The distribution achieves a significant runtime decrease. Furthermore, the effect of different distributions strategies on the overall runtime is evaluated.","['Eclipse', 'Java', 'JUnit', 'Test case distribution', 'Testing process improvements', 'Unit testing']","['Algorithm Selection, Optimization, Performance Measures, Transportation, Travelling Salesperson Problem']",en

Once software-units and-components have been tested, the integration of software-components itself must be tested. This dis-cipline of Integration Testing involves multiple sys-tems and resources (human and hardware) and the ef-fort for successfully implementing an integration test-ing scheme is easily underestimated. Yet errors de-tected in this phase of the testing process, may require fixes in the individual software components. Trivially, if many such problems appear, the testing process is de-layed and in the worst case, the roll-out of the system has to be rescheduled.

54189794,Understanding employees’ intention to take sabbaticals: Analyzing the role of supportive supervisors,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of supervisor support for employees’ work-life balance (WLB) on employees’ intention to take sabbaticals. According to the theory of planned behavior, intentions are based on attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, which mediate the relationship between supervisor support and the intention to take sabbaticals. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from 510 employees in Germany. The hypotheses developed are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that supervisor support has a direct negative effect on employees’ intention to take sabbaticals. In addition, supportive supervisors are associated with a decreased attitude toward sabbaticals, which reduces employees’ intention to take them. In contrast, supervisor support promotes employees’ perceived behavior control, which increases their intention to take sabbaticals. Practical implications: The findings show that supervisors play an important role in employees’ decision-making process regarding whether to take sabbaticals. If supervisors are supportive regarding employees’ WLB, the need to take sabbaticals decreases. However, in order to encourage participation and to exploit the positive outcomes of sabbaticals, supervisors should communicate the possibility of taking them. Originality/value: Prior research has focused solely on the direct link between supervisor support and the actual use of WLB policies. As behavior is intentional, it is important to understand how supervisor support affects employees’ intention to take sabbaticals. This paper explores the mechanism that explains the relationship between supervisor support and employees’ intention to take sabbaticals.","['Quantitative', 'Sabbaticals', 'Social information processing (SIP) theory', 'Structural equation modelling (SEM)', 'Supervisor support', 'Theory of planned behaviour (TPB)', 'Work-life balance (WLB) policies']",,en
54226324,evoStream - Evolutionary Stream Clustering Utilizing Idle Times,"Clustering is an important field in data mining that aims to reveal hidden patterns in data sets. It is widely popular in marketing or medical applications and used to identify groups of similar objects. Clustering possibly unbounded and evolving data streams is of particular interest due to the widespread deployment of large and fast data sources such as sensors. The vast majority of stream clustering algorithms employ a two-phase approach where the stream is first summarized in an online phase. Upon request, an offline phase reclusters the aggregations into the final clusters. In this setup, the online component will idle and wait for the next observation in times where the stream is slow. This paper proposes a new stream clustering algorithm called evoStream which performs evolutionary optimization in the idle times of the online phase to incrementally build and refine the final clusters. Since the online phase would idle otherwise, our approach does not reduce the processing speed while effectively removing the computational overhead of the offline phase. In extensive experiments on real data streams we show that the proposed algorithm allows to output clusters of high quality at any time within the stream without the need for additional computational resources.",Stream Clustering; Data Streams; Evolutionary Optimization; Machine Learning,"['Condition monitoring, Condition-based maintenance, Fault diagnostics, Machine learning']",en

Existing manual and digital means for monitoring customer behavior in high streets are expensive to employ and/or technically complex, making them unfeasible for many retailers. This paper shows an approach for individual stores and high streets as a whole to facilitate spatio-temporal customer data collection based on connected mobile devices, Bluetooth beacons, and an underlying multi-sided community platform. A framework of analytical perspectives on customer data regarding various levels of analysis and beneficiaries is conceived, which provides novel design knowledge on location-based smart services for customer behavior analysis and targeted advertising in high streets.","['Bluetooth beacon', 'Brick-and-mortar retail', 'Customer behavior analytics', 'Location-based advertising']",,en

54246921,Requirements Elicitation for an Inter-organizational Business Intelligence System for Small and Medium Retail Enterprises,"Business Intelligence (BI) is on everyone's lips nowadays, since it provides businesses with the possibility to analyze their business practices and improve them. However, Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) often cannot leverage the positive effects of BI because of missing resources like personnel, knowledge, or money. Since SME pose a major form of business organization, this fact has to be overcome. As the retail industry is a substantial part of the SME branch, we propose an inter-organizational approach for a BI system for retail SME, which allows them to collaboratively collect data and perform analysis task. The aim of our ongoing research effort is the development of such a system following the Design Science Research Methodology. Within this article, the status quo of current BI practices in SME in the retail industry is analyzed through qualitative interviews with ten SME managers. Afterward, adoption and success factors of BI systems and Inter-organizational Information Systems are worked out in a comprehensive structured literature review. On the basis of the status quo and the adoption and success factors, requirements for an inter-organizational BI system are identified and validated in another round of qualitative interviews. This leads to nine functional requirements and three non-functional requirements, which can be used for designing and implementing an inter-organizational BI system for SME in the following research efforts.",Business Intelligence; Inter-organizational Business Intelligence System; Inter-organizational Information Systems; Retail; Small and Medium Enterprises,"['Customer Experience Management', ' Entity-Relationship-Model', ' Omni-Channel Management']",en

Now, the digital transformation is yet again changing the way how retailers operate their business. After the introduction of different channel types, retailers now try to systematically manage these channels and thereby, blur the lines between those and the various customer touchpoints. This digitally-enabled channel management approach is called omni-channel management. One enabler of this approach is the digitalization of traditional customer touchpoints in brick {&amp;} mortar stores. However, omni-channel management currently lacks an Information Systems (IS)-perspective and most publications mainly deal with technical or marketing aspects. Thus, the impacts and opportunities of the digitalization of specific customer touchpoints are not entirely clear, making it hard for retailers to prioritize their store innovation projects. Therefore, the overall goal of this research is the generation of a theory, which supports retailers with their decisions regarding the digitalization of customer touchpoints. In this article, a guiding conceptual framework is developed as a basis for the research design. This research design guides the ongoing research efforts to determine the impacts of customer touchpoint digitalization on retail business processes.",Context Awareness; Digital Transformation; Digitalization; Omni‐Channel; Proactive; Process Innovation; Retail; Smart Retail; Touchpoint,,en

It combines the service marketing perspective of new service development (NSD) with the industry-academic collaboration perspective of action design research (ADR). The framework provides the entire IS community with a better understanding how joint research projects are conducted. Researchers that work in such projects can adopt the framework concepts and organize their projects accordingly. To demonstrate the framework's application, we use the case of the development of a smart service in electric vehicle domain.","['Action design research', 'Joint research projects', 'New service development', 'Practice-oriented research', 'Service research']","['New service development, Peer-to-peer, Provider assessment, Sharing and collaborative consumption, Sharing economy']",en
54301220,Designing Multi-sided Community Platforms for Local High Street Retail,"The continuing rise of online retail comes at the expense of small and medium-sized stores in local high streets. Many cities now experience substantial vacancies and the decline of independent and family-owned stores, impeding citizens' perceived quality of living. In this paper, we design the community platform 'smartmarket 2' with which networks of local retailers interact with networks of customers to co-create a physical and at the same time digital customer experience in a high street. The platform connects with retailers' information systems, while interfacing with in-store technologies to connect with potential customers' smartphones. From a theoretical perspective, the platform exemplifies how previous research on value co-creation, multi-sided (engagement) platforms, and retail communities can complement each other to constitute online-offline customer experience. Based on comparing smartmarket 2 with rival IT artifacts, we abstract nascent design knowledge by conceptualizing a design theory for 'community platforms for high street retail' as a new class of IT artifacts. We conclude the paper with identifying how digital services-including cross-promotions, geographical recommender systems, and geospatial analytics-may be offered on the platform to leverage the competitive position of small and medium-sized retailers in local high streets through online-offline customer experience.","['Community Platform', 'Design Science Research', 'High Street Retail', 'Value Co-Creation']","['Online propaganda, Social bots, Social media analysis, Social media computation']",en

Their processes describe the flow of persons through the networked systems, while Information Systems log the different steps. The prediction of how large numbers of customers will behave in the near future is a complex and yet unsolved challenge. However, the possible business benefits of predictive analytics in the tourism industry are manifold. We propose to approach this task with the yet unexploited appli-cation of predictive process mining. In a prototypical use case, we work together with two major European ski resorts. We implement a predictive process mining algorithm towards the goal of predicting near future lift arrivals of skiers within the ski resort in real-time.

In the enterprise context, web applications are popular client-server programs that provide rendered web pages as a user front-end, and the business logic is typically implemented on the server-side. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate test cases for component-based user interfaces for web applications built on the Java EE platform. We generate a sequence of user actions to navigate through the web application. For each supported user action, we gather constraints from the view template describing the web page (e.g. a button must be enabled in order to be clicked by a user), as well as constraints that are introduced while executing a server-side component. We have implemented our approach in a tool to determine its practical use in an experiment.","['Automated test case generation', 'Java enterprise edition', 'Symbolic execution', 'Web applications']","['Model-driven Software Development', ' Domain-Specific Language', ' Cross-platform Development', ' Mobile App', ' Business App Modellgetriebene Softwareentwicklung', ' Domänenspezifische Sprache', ' Cross-Plattform-Entwicklung', ' Mobile App', ' Business App']",en

However, negative effects, specifically collaborative overload, have only recently been acknowledged and are still rarely considered by companies. Collaborative overload is a multi-faceted construct, which covers downsides, unintended or side-effects of collaboration platforms and their organisational use. To introduce and explore what we believe is an important phenomenon, we conducted a narrative literature review to contextualise collaborative overload and to provide a structured account of underlying root causes. Based on this, we propose an agenda for future research and derive an initial research framework to clarify and delineate collaborative overload. With this twofold contribution, we aim to provide a frame of reference for the discourse about this important syndrome of modern workplaces.",collaboration platforms; knowledge worker productivity; collaborative overload,"['computer systems, computer programming, artificial intelligence, formal logic, semantics, databases, distributed computer systems, parallel processing systems, sofware engineering, logic programming, computer hardware, embedded systems, formal languages, functional programming, haskell, knowledge-based systems']",en

It is not surprising then that practitioners seek guidance on how to manage such transformation. Professional bodies have addressed this need by issuing best practice standards for Program Management (PgM), but we know little about their value in managing programs in general and IT programs in particular. Academic research on IT PgM is still in its very infancy. Taking this as motivation, we have investigated the challenges that managers faced in five IT programs that ran into trouble. Our analysis reveals a set of management issues and shortcomings including, among others, a lack of architectural overview, difficulties in dealing with scope changes, stakeholder interest, diverse business groups and cultures, as well as a lack of internal PgM competences and unclear management responsibilities. In this paper, based on our findings, we present a tentative checklist for managing the IT programs across their life cycle.

The analysis indicates that privacy concerns do not significantly influence users&rsquo; decision to use a webcam cover. Rather, this behavior is influenced by users&rsquo; attitudes, social environment, and perceived control over protecting privacy.

Target region-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (TMOEAs), aiming at a well-distributed subset of Pareto optimal solutions within the user-provided region(s), are extensively investigated in this paper. An empirical comparison is performed among three TMOEA instantiations: T-NSGA-II, T-SMS-EMOA and T-R2-EMOA. Experimental results show that T-SMS-EMOA has the best overall performance regarding the hypervolume indicator within the target region, while T-NSGA-II is the fastest algorithm. We also compare TMOEAs with other state-of-the-art preference-based approaches, i.e., DF-SMS-EMOA, RVEA, AS-EMOA and R-NSGA-II to show the advantages of TMOEAs. A case study in the mission planning of earth observation satellite is carried out to verify the capabilities of TMOEAs in the real-world application. Experimental results indicate that preferences can improve the searching ability of MOEAs, and TMOEAs can successfully find nondominated solutions preferred by the decision maker.",Target region; Preferences; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA); Satellite mission planning,"['Combinatorial optimization, Machine learning, Matrix calculus, Maximum margin clustering, Regularized least-squares classification, Semi-supervised support vector machines']",en

54566197,Assessment of Peer-provider Potentials to Share Private Electric Vehicle Charging Stations,"The diffusion and customer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) are hampered by the absence of a well-developed publicly accessible charging infrastructure. We introduce an IT-enabled peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and collaborative consumption (SCC) transportation service for private charging infrastructure as a means to alleviate this challenge. P2P SCC services facilitate private persons’ joint access to privately owned physical resources such as cars (Uber), apartments (Airbnb), or charging stations (focus of this article) via Internet-based sharing platforms. We apply New Service Development (NSD) as a guiding process towards developing a P2P SCC service and suggest provider assessment as an extension to existing NSD procedures. We show a specific application of the provider assessment for our proposed P2P SCC service by reporting the results from a survey assessing potential peer-providers. Thus, we demonstrate how extending NSD for the provider assessment aided us in developing an IT-enabled transportation service that is based on the joint access to privately owned resources.","['New service development', 'Peer-to-peer', 'Provider assessment', 'Sharing and collaborative consumption', 'Sharing economy']",,en

Recently published classification algorithms and frameworks focus on the identification of single bot accounts. Within different Twitter experiments, we show that these classifiers can be bypassed by hybrid approaches, which on a first glance may motivate further research for more sophisticated techniques. However, we pose the question, whether the detection of single bot accounts is a necessary condition for identifying malicious, strategic attacks on public opinion.

Computer-aided retrosynthesis would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results of unsatisfactory quality. Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind AB test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.",,"['Dimension reduction, Self-organizing feature maps, Support vector regression, Time-series monitoring, Wind energy, Wind prediction']",en

One important reason for its popularity is its theoretical foundation of global convergence. However, as the budgets in expensive optimization are very small, the asymptotic properties only play a minor role and the algorithm sometimes comes off badly in experimental comparisons. Many alternative variants have therefore been proposed over the years. In this work, we show experimentally that the algorithm instead has its strength in a setting where multiple optima are to be identified.",,"['Astronomy, Dimensionality reduction, Hubble sequence, Machine learning, Unsupervised nearest neighbors']",en

Estonia, for example, uses a one-stop portal, which allows centralized access to all provided governmental services. Germany, on the other hand, realizes integrated portals that link several separate portals on federal, state and municipal level. The governmental service provision is decentralized, but forwarding between different portals is established. These two portal types have different characteristics that result from their specific design. When administrations decide to plan and implement such portals, it is useful to adhere to success factors to ensure an effective development. This paper reviews academic literature on success factors for e-government initiatives. As different aspects might become more relevant for the different portal types, the importance of the success factors for each portal type is examined. This research helps administrations to focus on critical aspects of development according to the specific portal type.","['Digital government', 'E-government', 'One-stop shop', 'Portal development', 'Public administration']",,en
59995787,Model-Driven Software Development : Cross-Platform App Development and Further Applications of Domain-Specific Languages,"Smartphones have become ubiquitous devices and the ecosystem of mobile apps continues to thrive. This trend is amplified by the emergence of new mobile or wearable devices and further devices such as smart TVs have also become app-enabled. However, platform-specific functionality and user interface guidelines require repetitive implementations to reach a large number of users. Cross-platform approaches set out to reduce the development effort but are usually restricted to smartphones and tablets. The dissertation overcomes these limitations by analysing the challenges of app-enabled devices, categorising device classes, and assessing the applicability of current cross-platform approaches. Because the model-driven paradigm is particularly suited to solve the issues of pluri-platform development, the MAML framework is proposed as graphical domain-specific language (DSL) to facilitate the creation of business apps for a diverse audience of technical users and domain experts. In addition, the design of DSLs is scrutinised to ease language development by considering the perspectives of modularisation, preprocessing, and cross-cutting concerns.

This leads to varying temporal rhythms, which depict recurring patterns of activity in time, among workers, enabled by communication and collaboration technologies. The routine use of technology generates activity log data called digital traces, which promise an opportunity for a data-driven inquiry into temporal rhythms. While research using digital traces is scarce, various vendors claim to identify daily working hours based on email traces.

60017764,Efficient recurrent local search strategies for semi- and unsupervised regularized least-squares classification,"Binary classification tasks are among the most important ones in the field of machine learning. One prominent approach to address such tasks are support vector machines which aim at finding a hyperplane separating two classes well such that the induced distance between the hyperplane and the patterns is maximized. In general, sufficient labeled data is needed for such classification settings to obtain reasonable models. However, labeled data is often rare in real-world learning scenarios while unlabeled data can be obtained easily. For this reason, the concept of support vector machines has also been extended to semi- and unsupervised settings: in the unsupervised case, one aims at finding a partition of the data into two classes such that a subsequent application of a support vector machine leads to the best overall result. Similarly, given both a labeled and an unlabeled part, semi-supervised support vector machines favor decision hyperplanes that lie in a low density area induced by the unlabeled training patterns, while still considering the labeled part of the data. The associated optimization problems for both the semi- and unsupervised case, however, are of combinatorial nature and, hence, difficult to solve.

A variant with local parameterized Nadaraya-Watson models enhances the approach, and allows the adaptation of the model to local data space characteristics.

The learning problem of unsupervised kernel regression (UKR) is based on optimizing the latent variables, which is a multimodal problem with many local optima.

From a machine learning point of view, these settings often yield unsupervised, semi-supervised, or fully supervised tasks, with large training and huge test sets. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of prototype-based learning schemes such as simple nearest neighbor models. However, although being among the most computationally efficient methods for such settings (if implemented via spatial data structures), applying these models on all remaining patterns in a given catalog can easily take hours or even days. In this work, we investigate the practical effectiveness of GPU-based approaches to accelerate such nearest neighbor queries in this context.

This paper extends these results by (a) providing an alternative scheme that resorts to the effective use of support vector machines and by (b) addressing the more general task of non-linear decision boundaries. In particular, we make use of active learning strategies from the field of machine learning to select reasonable training points for the recurrent application of the classifier.

60018218,Polynomial Runtime Bounds for Fixed-Rank Unsupervised Least-Squares Classification,"Maximum margin clustering can be regarded as the direct extension of support vector machines to unsupervised learning scenarios. The goal is to partition unlabeled data into two classes such that a subsequent application of a support vector machine would yield the overall best result (with respect to the optimization problem associated with support vector machines). While being very appealing from a conceptual point of view, the combinatorial nature of the induced optimization problem renders a direct application of this concept difficult. In order to obtain efficient optimization schemes, various surrogates of the original problem definition have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we consider one of these variants, called unsupervised regularized least-squares classification, which is based on the square loss, and develop polynomial upper runtime bounds for the induced combinatorial optimization task. In particular, we show that for n patterns and kernel matrix of fixed rank r (with given eigendecomposition), one can obtain an optimal solution in O(nr) time for r ≤ 2 and in O(nr-1) time for r ≥ 3. The algorithmic framework is based on an interesting connection to the field of quadratic zero-one programming and permits the computation of exact solutions for the more general case of non-linear kernel functions in polynomial time.

60018578,Finding New High-Redshift Quasars by Asking the Neighbours,"Quasarswith a high redshift (z) are important to understand the evolution processes of galaxies in the early Universe. However, only a few of these distant objects are known to this date. The costs of building and operating a 10-m class telescope limit the number of facilities and, thus, the available observation time. Therefore, an efficient selection of candidates is mandatory. This paper presents a new approach to select quasar candidates with high redshift (z > 4.8) based on photometric catalogues. We have chosen to use the z > 4.8 limit for our approach because the dominant Lyman a emission line of a quasar can only be found in the Sloan i- and z-band filters. As part of the candidate selection approach, a photometric redshift estimator is presented, too.

The regularized least-squares based formulation of the problem allows us to use matrix algebraic optimization enabling constant time checks for the intermediate candidate solutions during the search.

60019025,Fast and simple gradient-based optimization for semi-supervised support vector machines,"One of the main learning tasks in machine learning is the one of classifying data items. The basis for such a task is usually a training set consisting of labeled patterns. In real-world settings, however, such labeled data are usually scarce, and the corresponding models might yield unsatisfying results. Unlabeled data, on the other hand, can often be obtained in huge quantities without much additional effort. A prominent research direction in the field of machine learning is semi-supervised support vector machines. This type of binary classification approach aims at taking the additional information provided by the unlabeled patterns into account to reveal more information about the structure of the data at hand. In some cases, this can yield significantly better classification results compared to a straightforward application of supervised models. One drawback, however, is the fact that generating such models requires solving difficult non-convex optimization tasks. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based optimization framework to address the induced problems.

In recent years, such semi-supervised extensions have gained considerable attention due to their huge potential for real-world applications with only small amounts of labeled data. While being appealing from a practical point of view, semi-supervised support vector machines lead to a combinatorial optimization problem that is difficult to address. Many optimization approaches have been proposed that aim at tackling this task. However, the computational requirements can still be very high, especially in case large data sets are considered and many model parameters need to be tuned. A recent trend in the field of big data analytics is to make use of graphics processing units to speed up computationally intensive tasks. In this work, such a massively-parallel implementation is developed for semi-supervised support vector machines.

60019298,Nearest Neighbor Density Ratio Estimation for Large-Scale Applications in Astronomy,"In astronomical applications of machine learning, the distribution of objects used for building a model is often different from the distribution of the objects the model is later applied to. This is known as sample selection bias, which is a major challenge for statistical inference as one can no longer assume that the labeled training data are representative. To address this issue, one can re-weight the labeled training patterns to match the distribution of unlabeled data that are available already in the training phase. There are many examples in practice where this strategy yielded good results, but estimating the weights reliably from a finite sample is challenging. We consider an efficient nearest neighbor density ratio estimator that can exploit large samples to increase the accuracy of the weight estimates. To solve the problem of choosing the right neighborhood size, we propose to use cross-validation on a model selection criterion that is unbiased under covariate shift. The resulting algorithm is our method of choice for density ratio estimation when the feature space dimensionality is small and sample sizes are large. The approach is simple and, because of the model selection, robust. We empirically find that it is on a par with established kernel-based methods on relatively small regression benchmark datasets. However, when applied to large-scale photometric redshift estimation, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art.","['Galaxies: distances and redshifts', 'Large-scale learning', 'Methods: data analysis', 'Methods: statistical', 'Nearest neighbors', 'Sample selection bias']","['Decision making, Dynamic optimization, Evolutionary algorithms, Multi-objective optimization, Vehicle routing']",en

60019564,Exploring the spectroscopic diversity of type Ia supernovae with DRACULA: A machine learning approach,"The existence of multiple subclasses of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been the subject of great debate in the last decade. One major challenge inevitably met when trying to infer the existence of one or more subclasses is the time consuming, and subjective, process of subclass definition. In this work, we show how machine learning tools facilitate identification of subtypes of SNe Ia through the establishment of a hierarchical group structure in the continuous space of spectral diversity formed by these objects. Using deep learning, we were capable of performing such identification in a four-dimensional feature space (+1 for time evolution), while the standard principal component analysis barely achieves similar results using 15 principal components. This is evidence that the progenitor system and the explosion mechanism can be described by a small number of initial physical parameters. As a proof of concept, we show that our results are in close agreement with a previously suggested classification scheme and that our proposed method can grasp the main spectral features behind the definition of such subtypes. This allows the confirmation of the velocity of lines as a first-order effect in the determination of SN Ia subtypes, followed by 91bg-like events. Given the expected data deluge in the forthcoming years, our proposed approach is essential to allow a quick and statistically coherent identification of SNe Ia subtypes (and outliers).

60019653,Sacrificing information for the greater good: how to select photometric bands for optimal accuracy,"Large-scale surveys make huge amounts of photometric data available. Because of the sheer amount of objects, spectral data cannot be obtained for all of them. Therefore, it is important to devise techniques for reliably estimating physical properties of objects from photometric information alone. These estimates are needed to automatically identify interesting objects worth a follow-up investigation as well as to produce the required data for a statistical analysis of the space covered by a survey.We argue that machine learning techniques are suitable to compute these estimates accurately and efficiently. This study promotes a feature selection algorithm, which selects the most informative magnitudes and colours for a given task of estimating physical quantities from photometric data alone. Using k-nearest neighbours regression, a well-known non-parametric machine learning method, we show that using the found features significantly increases the accuracy of the estimations compared to using standard features and standard methods. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by estimating specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and redshifts (photo-z's) using only the broad-band photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For estimating sSFRs, we demonstrate that our method produces better estimates than traditional spectral energy distribution fitting. For estimating photo-z's, we show that our method produces more accurate photo-z's than the method employed by SDSS. The study highlights the general importance of performing proper model selection to improve the results of machine learning systems and how feature selection can provide insights into the predictive relevance of particular input features.","['Galaxies: distances and redshifts', 'Galaxies: star formation', 'Galaxies: statistics', 'Methods: data analysis', 'Methods: statistical', 'Techniques: photometric']","['Dynamic optimization, Evolutionary algorithms, Running time analysis, Theory']",en
60019746,On the realistic validation of photometric redshifts,"Two of the main problems encountered in the development and accurate validation of photometric redshift (photo-z) techniques are the lack of spectroscopic coverage in the feature space (e.g. colours and magnitudes) and the mismatch between the photometric error distributions associated with the spectroscopic and photometric samples. Although these issues are well known, there is currently no standard benchmark allowing a quantitative analysis of their impact on the final photo-z estimation. In this work, we present two galaxy catalogues, Teddy and Happy, built to enable a more demanding and realistic test of photo-z methods. Using photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and spectroscopy from a collection of sources, we constructed data sets that mimic the biases between the underlying probability distribution of the real spectroscopic and photometric sample. We demonstrate the potential of these catalogues by submitting them to the scrutiny of different photo-z methods, including machine learning (ML) and template fitting approaches. Beyond the expected bad results from most ML algorithms for cases with missing coverage in the feature space, we were able to recognize the superiority of global models in the same situation and the general failure across all types of methods when incomplete coverage is convoluted with the presence of photometric errors - a data situation which photo-z methods were not trained to deal with up to now and which must be addressed by future large-scale surveys. Our catalogues represent the first controlled environment allowing a straightforward implementation of such tests.","['Catalogues-galaxies', 'Distances and redshifts', 'Methods: data analysis', 'Methods:statistical', 'Techniques:photometric']","['Adversarial Training, Deep Learning, Multi-step Adversaries']",en

60020311,A probabilistic approach to emission-line galaxy classification,"We invoke a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to jointly analyse two traditional emission-line classification schemes of galaxy ionization sources: the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) and WHa versus [N II]/H a (WHAN) diagrams, using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and SEAGal/STARLIGHT data sets. We apply a GMM to empirically define classes of galaxies in a three-dimensional space spanned by the log [O III]/Hβ, log [NII]/Hα and log EW(H α) optical parameters. The best-fitting GMM based on several statistical criteria suggests a solution around four Gaussian components (GCs), which are capable to explain up to 97 per cent of the data variance. Using elements of information theory, we compare each GC to their respective astronomical counterpart. GC1 and GC4 are associated with star-forming galaxies, suggesting the need to define a new starburst subgroup. GC2 is associated with BPT's active galactic nuclei (AGN) class and WHAN's weak AGN class. GC3 is associated with BPT's composite class and WHAN's strong AGN class. Conversely, there is no statistical evidence - based on four GCs - for the existence of a Seyfert/lowionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) dichotomy in our sample. Notwithstanding, the inclusion of an additional GC5 unravels it. The GC5 appears associated with the LINER and passive galaxies on the BPT and WHAN diagrams, respectively. This indicates that if the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is there, it does not account significantly to the global data variance and may be overlooked by standard metrics of goodness of fit. Subtleties aside, we demonstrate the potential of our methodology to recover/unravel different objects inside the wilderness of astronomical data sets, without lacking the ability to convey physically interpretable results.

60020879,Return of the features - Efficient feature selection and interpretation for photometric redshifts,"Context. The explosion of data in recent years has generated an increasing need for new analysis techniques in order to extract knowledge from massive data-sets. Machine learning has proved particularly useful to perform this task. Fully automatized methods (e.g. deep neural networks) have recently gathered great popularity, even though those methods often lack physical interpretability. In contrast, feature based approaches can provide both well-performing models and understandable causalities with respect to the correlations found between features and physical processes. Aims. Efficient feature selection is an essential tool to boost the performance of machine learning models. In this work, we propose a forward selection method in order to compute, evaluate, and characterize better performing features for regression and classification problems. Given the importance of photometric redshift estimation, we adopt it as our case study. Methods. We synthetically created 4520 features by combining magnitudes, errors, radii, and ellipticities of quasars, taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We apply a forward selection process, a recursive method in which a huge number of feature sets is tested through a k-Nearest-Neighbours algorithm, leading to a tree of feature sets. The branches of the feature tree are then used to perform experiments with the random forest, in order to validate the best set with an alternative model. Results. We demonstrate that the sets of features determined with our approach improve the performances of the regression models significantly when compared to the performance of the classic features from the literature. The found features are unexpected and surprising, being very different from the classic features. Therefore, a method to interpret some of the found features in a physical context is presented. Conclusions. The feature selection methodology described here is very general and can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models for any regression or classification task.","['Galaxies: distances', 'Methods: data analysis', 'Methods: statistical', 'Quasars: general', 'Redshifts']","['Agent-based modeling, algorithmic bias, computational methods, social network analysis, text mining.']",en

These data allow scientists to investigate various important issues, such as land use changes, on a global scale. However, not all land-use phenomena are equally visible on satellite imagery. In particular, the creation of an inventory of the planet's road infrastructure remains a challenge, despite being crucial to analyze urbanization patterns and their impact. Towards this end, this work advances data-driven approaches for the automatic identification of roads based on open satellite data. Given the typical resolutions of these historical satellite data, we observe that there is inherent variation in the visibility of different road types. Based on this observation, we propose two deep learning frameworks that extend state-of-the-art deep learning methods by formalizing road detection as an ordinal classification task. In contrast to related schemes, one of the two models also resorts to satellite time series data that are potentially affected by missing data and cloud occlusion. Taking these time series data into account eliminates the need to manually curate datasets of high-quality image tiles, substantially simplifying the application of such models on a global scale. We evaluate our approaches on a dataset that is based on Sentinel 2 satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap vector data.

One drawback is, however, that many of these models are overparameterized, which makes them both computationally and memory intensive. Furthermore, overparameterization can also lead to undesired overfitting side-effects. Inspired by recently proposed magnitude-based pruning schemes and the Wald test from the field of statistics, we introduce a novel magnitude and uncertainty (MU) pruning criterion that helps to lessen such shortcomings. One important advantage of our MU pruning criterion is that it is scale-invariant, a phenomenon that the magnitude-based pruning criterion suffers from. In addition, we present a 'pseudo bootstrap' scheme, which can efficiently estimate the uncertainty of the weights by using their update information during training. Our experimental evaluation, which is based on various neural network architectures and datasets, shows that our new criterion leads to more compressed models compared to models that are solely based on magnitude-based pruning criteria, with, at the same time, less loss in predictive power.","['Neural network compression', 'overparameterization', 'pruning', 'Wald test']","['Stream Clustering', ' Data Streams', ' Automated Machine Learning', ' Algorithm Configuration', ' Algorithm Selection']",en

60042939,Trust is essential: Positive effects of information systems on users’ memory,"Initial results suggest that decision support systems (DSSs) can trigger &lsquo;directed forgetting' in business settings if users trust in the DSS (Hertel et al., 2019). In the present study, we further examined this trust effect on DSS-cued forgetting and related positive effects on users' cognitive resources, performance, and well-being. Moreover, we investigated how trust translates into behavioral intentions to use a DSS, and into actual usage of the DSS. Finally, we examined if risk-related framing of decision outcomes (loss vs. gain framing) moderates trust effects on directed forgetting and behavioral intentions. In line with our expectations, results of an experiment with N = 200 participants confirmed that trust significantly enhances directed forgetting, performance, and well-being.

60051342,To Row Together or Paddle One's Own Canoe? Simulating Strategies to Spur Digital Platform Growth,"This study provides a novel perspective on digital platform dynamics by applying a stochastic cellular automaton (CA) as a promising instrument of inquiry to investigate the impact of social and technical openness on platform growth. Owing to the dynamism of digital platforms caused by technological complexity, network effects, and developer-level factors, there is limited understanding of how early-stage platform owners can successfully sustain platform growth. Research suggests two growth strategies: Adjusting the openness of technical platform resources and governing the developers' accessibility of the distribution channel. Based on experiments that leverage a stochastic CA, we show that platform growth can be achieved through three disparate growth strategy configurations. Our paper contributes to research by synthesizing the technology, market, and individual levels of platform growth analyses through a novel methodological account, and by offering theoretical propositions for future research. Our results can guide platform owners to scrutinize their growth strategies.","['Negotiated platform access', 'Platform growth', 'Platform openness', 'Stochastic cellular automaton']","['Assessment', ' Gamification', ' Recruitment', ' Human resources', ' Serious games', ' Video games']",en
60056234,Structured Traversal of Search Trees in Constraint-logic Object-oriented Programming,"In this paper, we propose an explicit, non-strict representation of search trees in constraint-logic object-oriented programming. Our search tree representation includes both the non-deterministic and deterministic behaviours of executing an application. Introducing such a representation facilitates the use of various search strategies. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we incorporate explicit search trees into the virtual machine of the constraint-logic object-oriented programming language Muli. We then exemplarily implement three search algorithms that traverse the search tree on-demand: depth-first search, breadth-first search, and iterative deepening depth-first search. In particular, the last two strategies allow for a complete search, which is novel in constraint-logic object-oriented programming and highlights our main contribution. Finally, we compare the implemented strategies using several benchmarks.","['Complete search strategy', 'Constraint-logic object-oriented programming', 'Explicit search tree', 'Virtual machine implementation']","['Digital government, E-government, Forms, Graphical user interface, Meta-modeling, Public administration, Reference modeling, Standardization']",en
60062555,Parallelization Strategies for GPU- Based Ant Colony Optimization Applied to TSP,"Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been widely used to speed up the execu-tion of various meta-heuristics for solving hard optimization problems. In the caseof Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), many implementations with very distinct par-allelization strategies and speedups have been already proposed and evaluated onthe Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). On the one hand, a coarse-grained strategyapplies the parallelization on the ant-level and is the most intuitive and commonstrategy found in the literature. On the other hand, a fine-grained strategy also par-allelizes the internal work of each ant, creating a higher degree of parallelization.Although many parallel implementations of ACO exist, the influence of the algo-rithm parameters (e.g., the number of ants) and the problem configurations (e.g.,the number of nodes in the graph) on the performance of coarse- and fine-grainedparallelization strategies has not been investigated so far. Thus, this work performsa series of experiments and provides speedup analyses of two distinct ACO par-allelization strategies compared to a sequential implementation for different TSPconfigurations and colony sizes. The results show that the considered factors cansignificantly impact the performance of parallelization strategies, particularly forlarger problems. Furthermore, we provide a recommendation for the parallelizationstrategy and colony size to use for a given problem size and some insights for thedevelopment of other GPU-based meta-heuristics.",Parallel Ant Colony Optimization; Graphic Processing Units; Parallelization; Strategies,"['Social Bots', ' Implementation', ' Code sharing', ' Data analysis']",en
60064950,Towards Decision Support in Dynamic Bi-Objective Vehicle Routing,"We consider a dynamic bi-objective vehicle routing problem, where a subset of customers ask for service over time. Therein, the distance traveled by a single vehicle and the number of unserved dynamic requests is minimized by a dynamic evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (DEMOA), which operates on discrete time windows (eras). A decision is made at each era by a decision-maker, thus any decision depends on irreversible decisions made in foregoing eras. To understand effects of sequences of decision-making and interactions/dependencies between decisions made, we conduct a series of experiments. More precisely, we fix a set of decision-maker preferences D and the number of eras nt and analyze all |D|^{n_{t}} combinations of decision-maker options. We find that for random uniform instances (a) the final selected solutions mainly depend on the final decision and not on the decision history, (b) solutions are quite robust with respect to the number of unvisited dynamic customers, and (c) solutions of the dynamic approach can even dominate solutions obtained by a clairvoyant EMOA. In contrast, for instances with clustered customers, we observe a strong dependency on decision-making history as well as more variance in solution diversity.","['combinatorial optimization', 'decision making', 'dynamic optimization', 'multi-objective optimization', 'orienteering', 'Transportation', 'vehicle routing']","['Nostalgia', ' Emotion: Text classification']",en
60065038,Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms with Biased Mutation for the Multi-Objective Minimum Spanning Tree Problem,"Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose problem solvers that usually perform an unbiased search. This is reasonable and desirable in a black-box scenario. For combinatorial optimization problems, often more knowledge about the structure of optimal solutions is given, which can be leveraged by means of biased search operators. We consider the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem in a single- and multi-objective version, and introduce a biased mutation, which puts more emphasis on the selection of edges of low rank in terms of low domination number. We present example graphs where the biased mutation can significantly speed up the expected runtime until (Pareto-)optimal solutions are found. On the other hand, we demonstrate that bias can lead to exponential runtime if ""heavy"" edges are necessarily part of an optimal solution. However, on general graphs in the single-objective setting, we show that a combined mutation operator which decides for unbiased or biased edge selection in each step with equal probability exhibits a polynomial upper bound - as unbiased mutation - in the worst case and benefits from bias if the circumstances are favorable.","['Biased mutation', 'Evolutionary algorithms', 'Minimum spanning tree problem', 'Runtime analysis']",,en
60065127,Dynamic Bi-Objective Routing  of Multiple Vehicles,"In practice, e.g. in delivery and service scenarios, Vehicle-Routing-Problems (VRPs) often imply repeated decision making on dynamic customer requests. As in classical VRPs, tours have to be planned short while the number of serviced customers has to be maximized at the same time resulting in a multi-objective problem. Beyond that, however, dynamic requests lead to the need for re-planning of not yet realized tour parts, while already realized tour parts are irreversible. In this paper we study this type of bi-objective dynamic VRP including sequential decision making and concurrent realization of decisions. We adopt a recently proposed Dynamic Evolutionary Multi-Objective Algorithm (DEMOA) for a related VRP problem and extend it to the more realistic (here considered) scenario of multiple vehicles. We empirically show that our DEMOA is competitive with a multi-vehicle offline and clairvoyant variant of the proposed DEMOA as well as with the dynamic single-vehicle approach proposed earlier.","['Decision making', 'Dynamic optimization', 'Evolutionary algorithms', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Vehicle routing']","['Affective Politics, Discourse, Game Engine, Group Dynamics, Technology Buy-In, Technology Framing']",en

60067568,Initial Design Strategies and their Effects on Sequential Model-Based Optimization: An Exploratory Case Study Based on BBOB,"Sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) approaches are algorithms for solving problems that require computationally or otherwise expensive function evaluations. The key design principle of SMBO is a substitution of the true objective function by a surrogate, which is used to propose the point(s) to be evaluated next. SMBO algorithms are intrinsically modular, leaving the user with many important design choices. Significant research efforts go into understanding which settings perform best for which type of problems. Most works, however, focus on the choice of the model, the acquisition function, and the strategy used to optimize the latter. The choice of the initial sampling strategy, however, receives much less attention. Not surprisingly, quite diverging recommendations can be found in the literature. We analyze in this work how the size and the distribution of the initial sample influences the overall quality of the efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm, a well-known SMBO approach. While, overall, small initial budgets using Halton sampling seem preferable, we also observe that the performance landscape is rather unstructured. We furthermore identify several situations in which EGO performs unfavorably against random sampling. Both observations indicate that an adaptive SMBO design could be beneficial, making SMBO an interesting test-bed for automated algorithm design.","['Continuous black-box optimization', 'Design of experiments', 'Initial design', 'Sequential model-based optimization']","['enantioselectivity prediction, machine learning, molecular structures, organic chemistry, reactivity prediction, yield prediction']",en
60067657,The Node Weight Dependent Traveling Salesperson Problem: Approximation Algorithms and Randomized Search Heuristics,"Several important optimization problems in the area of vehicle routing can be seen as variants of the classical Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In the area of evolutionary computation, the Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) has gained increasing interest over the last 5 years. In this paper, we investigate the effect of weights on such problems, in the sense that the cost of traveling increases with respect to the weights of nodes already visited during a tour. This provides abstractions of important TSP variants such as the Traveling Thief Problem and time dependent TSP variants, and allows to study precisely the increase in difficulty caused by weight dependence. We provide a 3.59-approximation for this weight dependent version of TSP with metric distances and bounded positive weights. Furthermore, we conduct experimental investigations for simple randomized local search with classical mutation operators and two variants of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm EAX adapted to the weighted TSP. Our results show the impact of the node weights on the position of the nodes in the resulting tour.","['Dynamic optimization', 'Evolutionary algorithms', 'Running time analysis', 'Theory']","['data marketplace, data purchase, decision support, intelligent algorithms']",en
60067746,Enhancing Resilience of Deep Learning Networks By Means of Transferable Adversaries,"Artificial neural networks in general and deep learning networks in particular established themselves as popular and powerful machine learning algorithms. While the often tremendous sizes of these networks are beneficial when solving complex tasks, the tremendous number of parameters also causes such networks to be vulnerable to malicious behavior such as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations can change a model's classification decision. Moreover, while single-step adversaries can easily be transferred from network to network, the transfer of more powerful multi-step adversaries has - usually - been rather difficult.In this work, we introduce a method for generating strong adversaries that can easily (and frequently) be transferred between different models. This method is then used to generate a large set of adversaries, based on which the effects of selected defense methods are experimentally assessed. At last, we introduce a novel, simple, yet effective approach to enhance the resilience of neural networks against adversaries and benchmark it against established defense methods. In contrast to the already existing methods, our proposed defense approach is much more efficient as it only requires a single additional forward-pass to achieve comparable performance results.","['Adversarial Training', 'Deep Learning', 'Multi-step Adversaries']",,en

The two sophisticated heuristic solvers LKH and EAX and respective (restart) variants manage to calculate close-to optimal or even optimal solutions, also for large instances with several thousand nodes in reasonable time. In this work we extend existing benchmarking studies by addressing anytime behaviour of inexact TSP solvers based on empirical runtime distributions leading to an increased understanding of solver behaviour and the respective relation to problem hardness. It turns out that performance ranking of solvers is highly dependent on the focused approximation quality. Insights on intersection points of performances offer huge potential for the construction of hybridized solvers depending on instance features. Moreover, instance features tailored to anytime performance and corresponding performance indicators will highly improve automated algorithm selection models by including comprehensive information on solver quality.","['anytime behavior', 'automated algorithm selection', 'hybridization', 'performance assessment', 'traveling salesperson problem']",,en

60078588,FakeYou! - A Gamified Approach for Building and Evaluating Resilience Against Fake News,"Nowadays fake news are heavily discussed in public and political debates. Even though the phenomenon of intended false information is rather old, misinformation reaches a new level with the rise of the internet and participatory platforms. Due to Facebook and Co., purposeful false information - often called fake news - can be easily spread by everyone. Because of high data volatility and variety in content types (text, images,..) debunking of fake news is a complex challenge. This is especially true for automated approaches, which are prone to fail validating the veracity of the information. This Work focuses on a gamified approach to strengthen the resilience of consumers towards fake news. The game FakeYou motivates its players to critically analyze headlines regarding their trustworthiness. Further, the game follows a “learning by doing strategy”: by generating own fake headlines, users should experience the concepts of convincing fake headline formulations. We introduce the game itself, as well as the underlying technical infrastructure. A first evaluation study shows, that users tend to use specific stylistic devices to generate fake news. Further, the results indicate, that creating good fakes and identifying correct headlines are challenging and hard to learn.","['Fake news', 'Game', 'Misinformation', 'Mobile game', 'News']","['Internet of Things', ' quality of IoT systems', ' IoT architecture', ' IoT architecture design', ' software quality attributes', ' design tactics', ' architectural patterns']",en

However, this requires huge financial investments for algorithmic implementations, data collection, and model training, which only big players can afford. To support smaller or medium-sized media enterprises (SME), we developed an integrated comment moderation system as an IT platform. This platform acts as a service provider and offers Analytics as a Service (AaaS) to SMEs.

By monitoring the network traffic, a security monitor passively learns the network characteristics of the applications installed on each machine, and uses them to detect the presence of new applications (e.g., malware infection). In this work, we propose HeadPrint, a novel passive fingerprinting approach that relies only on two orthogonal network header characteristics to distinguish applications, namely the order of the headers and their associated values. Our approach automatically identifies the set of characterizing headers, without relying on a predetermined set of header features. We implement HeadPrint, evaluate it in a real-world environment and we compare it with the state-of-the-art solution for passive application fingerprinting. We demonstrate our approach to be, on average, 20% more accurate and 30% more resilient to application updates than the state-of-the-art. Finally, we evaluate our approach in the setting of anomaly detection, and we show that HeadPrint is capable of detecting the presence of malicious communication, while generating significantly fewer false alarms than existing solutions.","['Anomaly detection', 'Application fingerprinting', 'Network security']",,en

This paper proposes the first approach for automated algorithm selection and configuration of stream clustering algorithms. We train an ensemble of different stream clustering algorithms and configurations in parallel and use the best performing configuration to obtain a clustering solution. By drawing new configurations from better performing ones, we are able to improve the ensemble performance over time. In large experiments on real and artificial data we show how our ensemble approach can improve upon default configurations and can also compete with a-posteriori algorithm configuration. Our approach is considerably faster than a-posteriori approaches and applicable in real-time.

In order to achieve this aim, messages should be encrypted. While there is not a constant path between two specific nodes in OppNet, it is not possible to use traditional solutions such as a trusted third party for sharing the public key. In this paper, a new confidentiality structure is proposed in order to encrypt the messages and sharing nodes’ public key in Opportunistic Networks.

For node to node communication, messages are exchanged opportunistically with the aim of progressing the message towards the intended destination node. To send a message from a sender node to the final receiver node, the optimized route, composed of different nodes is identified by inspecting the history table, which has been created by each node based on previous interactions. Therefore, history table security is a must to prevent leaking of data or privacy and integrity compromise.

We conclude by highlighting the consequent need for greater political and ethical awareness about the framing of IS and by proposing a framework for conceptualizing actors’ orientations toward and thus possible buy-in or resistance to technology framing.","['Affective Politics', 'Discourse', 'Game Engine', 'Group Dynamics', 'Technology Buy-In', 'Technology Framing']",,en

60188674,The Long and Winding Road of Digital Public Services—One Next Step: Proactivity,"Public sector organizations have been digitalizing their services for many years. As one potential next step of digitalization, public organizations have started to transform their services from reactive to proactive delivery; i.e., delivering service to a recipient without the recipient having to request for the service. Although the academic literature provides conceptualizations of digitally enabled public service delivery, the effects of proactivity on these conceptualizations are unclear. This paper presents ongoing research aiming to address how proactivity changes digitally enabled public service delivery. Based on a qualitative literature review and conceptual discussion, we combine theoretical works in both areas-digital public service delivery and proactivity-to obtain a preliminary conceptual framework for understanding digitally enabled proactive public service delivery. The results include that proactive delivery enables equal treatment of recipients, requires no interaction with the recipient, but is applicable only to compulsory services with clear-cut assessment criteria for service eligibility.","['Digital Government', 'Digital Service', 'No-Stop Government', 'No-Stop Shop', 'Proactive Government', 'Public Administration', 'Public Service']",,en
60198713,A Structure-Based Platform for Predicting Chemical Reactivity,"Despite their enormous potential, machine learning methods have only found limited application in predicting reaction outcomes, because current models are often highly complex and, most importantly, are not transferable to different problem sets. Here, we present a structure-based machine learning platform for diverse applications in organic chemistry. Therefore, an input based on multiple fingerprint features (MFFs) as a versatile molecular representation was developed that was shown to be applicable over a range of diverse problem sets. First, molecular properties across a diverse array of molecules could be predicted accurately. Next, reaction outcomes such as stereoselectivities and yields were predicted for experimental datasets that were previously evaluated using (complex) problem-oriented descriptor models. As a final application, a systematic high-throughput dataset was investigated as a “real-world problem,” and good correlation was observed when using the structure-based model. Statistical data-based prediction models have found widespread application in nearly all areas of science, including chemistry. In this context, the prediction of molecular properties or biological activities for a target molecule (quantitative structure-property relationships [QSPRs]) has been widely investigated, with great focus on developing new and general molecular representations. However, the underlying fundamentals have not been transferred to the prediction of chemical reactivity. In contrast, although recent progress in high-throughput data generation has enabled the generation of uniform reaction-based datasets, current prediction models suggest that complex parameterization is required for each individual case to achieve good results. Applying universal (structure-based) molecular representations to the prediction of chemical reactivity could provide a readily applicable model, which could potentially decrease the barriers to apply machine learning techniques in organic synthesis. Although machine learning has a long-standing history in chemical research with respect to the prediction of molecular properties and biological activities, the quantitative modeling of reactivity has only been approached recently, and current models suggest that complex and specific parameterization is inevitable. As opposed to this, we report a simple machine learning model for predicting various reaction outcomes, such as yields and stereoselectivities. Being based on a solely structural input, our model should be transferable to diverse problems related to organic molecules.","['enantioselectivity prediction', 'machine learning', 'molecular structures', 'organic chemistry', 'reactivity prediction', 'yield prediction']",,en
60220084,Supporting Customers with Limited Budget in Data Marketplaces,"As the competitiveness and dynamics of current markets intensify, companies and organizations see opportunities to optimize their strategies and increase their business advantage in data-driven decision-making. This has led to an emergence of data marketplaces, where providers can sell data, while consumers can purchase it. However, the process of acquiring data from a marketplace involves issuing queries with an associated monetary cost, and data consumers often struggle to purchase the targeted data set of appropriate volume and content within their budget. Two issues need to be considered: One is querying itself, which may require API calls, structured queries written in SQL, graph queries written in Neo4J, or any other language framework. Querying is often a stepwise process that starts from generic queries and gets refined as the user learns about the data that results. The other issue is the cost involved, which consists of the price a consumer has to pay for the data and that of processing the various queries. In this paper, the second issue is studied from a computational perspective; in particular, we propose a novel framework for data-purchase support that considers data purchase from a marketplace as a sequence of interactions between the data provider (or the marketplace) and the consumer. This allows us to deal with scenarios in which the consumer has a limited budget, insufficient to embrace the complete data set he or she targets. We formalize the problem setting and the characteristics of available queries offered by the data provider so that efficient (approximation) algorithms can be devised. Our empirical results demonstrate that intelligent algorithms can aid the data consumer with near-optimum solutions that consider her preferences about the queries to be issue to the data provider.","['data marketplace', 'data purchase', 'decision support', 'intelligent algorithms']",,en

Instead of assigning one best reviewer and then looking for a second-best match, we want to start from a single reviewer and look for a diverse group of other possible candidates, that would complement the first one in order to cover multiple areas of the review.

60222378,Assessing the Financial Value of Real-Time Energy Trading Services for Privately Owned Non-Commercial Electric Vehicles,"Real-time energy trading services for privately owned non-commercial electric vehicles are characterized by an e-vehicle provider, by a provider of energy trading skills and technology, and by the fact that the latter manages (dis-)charging of the e-vehicle of the former with real-time energy prices. We conduct a simulation study to present a comprehensive assessment of the financial value of such services. Such an assessment is required in order to provide policymakers with guidance on if and how real-time trading services can serve as a tool to incentivize e-vehicle ownership. We propose a fully reproducible simulation model of the value creation process of real-time trading services, and use the model to assess services with a range of e-vehicle provider characteristics as well as with a range of technology setups. Our empirical results show that all considered real-time trading services are able to create significant energy cost savings, and that overall cost savings strongly depend on technology characteristics, surcharge rate, as well as on the e-vehicle provider's commute, household size, and office hours. We show that services including solar energy generation have the largest economic potential but do not necessarily maximize renewable energy deployment with residential households. We conclude with recommendations for policymakers on how to tap the full economic potential of real-time trading services for stimulating the adoption of e-vehicles.","['Economic barrier', 'Electric vehicles', 'Energy trading', 'Vehicle-to-grid']",,en

Substantial research efforts have been put into the investigation and algorithmic resolution of the problem. Different aspects such as “cyberbullying”, “hate speech” or “profanity” have undergone ample amounts of investigation, however, often using inconsistent vocabulary such as “offensive language” or “harassment”. This led to a state of confusion within the research community. The inconsistency can be considered an inhibitor for the domain: It increases the risk of unintentional redundant work and leads to undifferentiated and thus hard to use and justifiable machine learning classifiers. To remedy this effect, this paper introduces a novel configurable, multi-view approach to define abusive language concepts.","['Abusive language', 'Harassment', 'Hate speech', 'Machine learning', 'Offensive language']",,en

The public and academic discourse is replete with critical assessments of potentially unhealthy behaviors that can result from this “constant connectivity”. This pilot study explores the notion of constant connectivity and investigates why people continue to engage in such behaviors by using a student sample. We propose to conceptualize constant connectivity as a three-tiered phenomenon and study work ethic, social expectations and emotional reward as its antecedents. In contrast to our expectations, our findings do not support that work ethic serves as a good predictor for constant connectivity. However, a perceived reward for using the smartphone and beliefs regarding the expected timing between receiving and responding to a message both positively affected behaviors of constant connectivity. Our study thus suggests that individuals have an emotional connection to their smartphone rather than seeing it as a tool to conduct work with.","['Constant Connectivity', 'Smartphone', 'Work Ethic']","['Entropy methods, Exponential decay, Fokker-Planck equations, Logarithmic-sobolev inequality, Mass evolution']",en

The trade-off between the fraction of failed runs and the mean runtime of successful runs &ndash; both to be minimized &ndash; is directly analyzed based on a study on algorithm selection of inexact state-of-the-art solvers for the famous Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Moreover, we adopt the hypervolume (HV)indicator commonly used in multi-objective optimization for simultaneously assessing both conflicting objectives and investigate relations to commonly used performance indicators, both theoretically and empirically. Next to Penalized Average Runtime (PAR) and Penalized Quantile Runtime (PQR), the HV measure is used as a core concept within the construction of per-instance algorithm selection models offering interesting insights into complementary behavior of inexact TSP solvers.",Algorithm selection; Multi-objective optimization; Performance measurement; Combinatorial optimization; Traveling Salesperson Problem,"['Reverse engineering, Object oriented modeling, Tools, Systematics, Analytical models, Bibliographies, Search engines, reverse engineering, model-driven reverse engineering, model definition, model extraction, model transformation, genericity, extensibility, Models, reverse engineering, model-driven reverse engineering, model transformation, legacy system']",en
60334407,Comprehensive Feature-Based Landscape Analysis of Continuous and Constrained Optimization Problems Using the R-package flacco,"Choosing the best-performing optimizer(s) out of a portfolio of optimization algorithms is usually a difficult and complex task. It gets even worse, if the underlying functions are unknown, i.e., so-called black-box problems, and function evaluations are considered to be expensive. In case of continuous single-objective optimization problems, exploratory landscape analysis (ELA), a sophisticated and effective approach for characterizing the landscapes of such problems by means of numerical values before actually performing the optimization task itself, is advantageous. Unfortunately, until now it has been quite complicated to compute multiple ELA features simultaneously, as the corresponding code has been—if at all—spread across multiple platforms or at least across several packages within these platforms. This article presents a broad summary of existing ELA approaches and introduces flacco, an R-package for feature-based landscape analysis of continuous and constrained optimization problems. Although its functions neither solve the optimization problem itself nor the related algorithm selection problem (ASP), it offers easy access to an essential ingredient of the ASP by providing a wide collection of ELA features on a single platform—even within a single package. In addition, flacco provides multiple visualization techniques, which enhance the understanding of some of these numerical features, and thereby make certain landscape properties more comprehensible. On top of that, we will introduce the package’s built-in, as well as web-hosted and hence platform-independent, graphical user interface (GUI). It facilitates the usage of the package—especially for people who are not familiar with R—and thus makes flacco a very convenient toolbox when working towards algorithm selection of continuous single-objective optimization problems.",,,en

The parallelization of ACO becomes necessary when tackling bigger instances of the TSP due to the high number of calculations performed. Many parallel approaches have been already proposed for ACO, in particular for contemporary high-performance hardware, such as GPUs. Typically, the ants are treated in parallel, since they are largely independent. In the case of the TSP, this concerns in particular the tour construction phase. Furthermore, strategies for parallelizing the pheromone deposit and evaporation phase were proposed. The achieved overall speedup hence depends on a combination of different parallelization strategies, where the impact of each strategy depends on the characteristics of the considered application problem and the hardware used. In the present paper, we aim to compare and analyze the performance of ACO implementations using distinct parallelization strategies when solving TSP instances of different magnitudes. At first, a comparison is made between a coarse-grain and a fine-grain parallel ACO. Furthermore the impact of the parallelization of the pheromone deposit process is also analyzed.

For this purpose, we apply particle swarm optimization and fish school search to optimize the parameters of the cost function by comparing the matching results to the assessments of students and teachers. We further show the complexity of the resulting fitness function and justify the application of swarm intelligent heuristics for such application scenarios.","['fish school search', 'graph edit distance', 'parameter optimization', 'particle swarm optimization']",,en

60446037,Towards a framework for educational university-industry cooperation: Industry perspective,"Information systems discipline is a quickly developing field of knowledge and to cope with these changes universities have to constantly adjust their curriculum according to industry needs. Therefore universities can highly profit from the cooperation with enterprise partners. On the other hand, enterprises are also interested in closer contact with academia where they can find innovative and commercializable ideas and hire recent college graduates. However, studies still show the discrepancy in needed skill perception between industry and education. Literature on the topic also reports about a number of existing barriers towards establishing successful university-industry cooperation. In this paper, we try to address these problems by proposing a framework for establishing and managing the long-term educational university-industry cooperation. The framework was constructed based on the results of a case study of an existing cooperation between an IT service company and a regional university. The framework incorporates the industry perspective on the cooperation process.","['Educational cooperation', 'Framework', 'Is education', 'University-Industry cooperation']","['abusive language, hate speech, machine learning, moderation, multi-label']",en

60446225,Natural language oral communication in humans under stress. Linguistic cognitive coping strategies for enrichment of artificial intelligence,"Learning computer systems to recognize natural human speech is significantly easier and more effective when the cognitive process in humans is understood. Psycholinguistics, as an interdisciplinary study of language and cognition, is extremely helpful in this respect. The aim of this study is to understand which linguistic coping strategies people develop under stress, due to their physiological and psychological structure. Oral communication in a foreign language (English), of people with different backgrounds, will be examined under an isolation stressor. It is expected that the physiological parameters (adrenaline and noradrenaline blood-level amounts) and psychological parameters (anxiety tendencies) influence the linguistic performance in a stressful situation. Subjects who share a similar organization of the central nervous system and psychological structure, may also share similarities in cognition regarding language production in a foreign language. The value of the study for artificial intelligence research is applicable to natural language systems, i.e. by helping program a more precise speech recognizing system.","['AI theory', 'Cognitive linguistics', 'Natural language']",,en

The study lasted the several years have proven the usability of Design Thinking process while developing user-centered and complex IT applications [2]. Although, for the Prototyping phase of the process was crucial for providing a solution. After completing several studies on development teams and analyzing prototypes we unleash that when teams worked with serious and complex technologies can struggle with providing high-quality and industry-approved solutions. As a result, this followed by lack of trust from industry vendors and frustration from team members. Providing the Internet of Things solutions from one side means establishing user-centric approach and interaction between users and strict software architecture from the other side [3]. However, the Design Thinking Prototype phase does not cover the complying with quality requirements of the software products. This lead to the significant gap between developed prototype and proposed industry solution which can cause impediments in the implementation of the project. On the other side, the Internet of Think field has been developed more than 10 years and several research studies have identified the critical points and requirements for the working projects [4]. These requirements were followed by the architecture patterns and tactics each of them is intended to improve the quality attributes of the project [5]. As a result, the sustainable IoT prototype should meet these attributes. As a solution, the visual functional and software framework for IoT Prototyping phase was proposed. The framework undertakes the problem of lack of knowledge in design team and aims to improve quality of the prototypes. Evaluation of the achievable attributes with respect to current research works is mentioned. The testing and implementation of the reference framework currently are in testing process by the DT teams.",,,en

Here, we focus on the question how a difference in the length of neurites affects vesicle transport. We performed live imaging experiments and present a lattice-based model to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of intracellular transport in neurons. After a motivation and appropriate scaling of the model we present numerical simulations showing that initial differences in neurite length result in phenomena of biological relevance, i.e. a positive feedback that enhances transport into the longer neurite and oscillation of vesicles concentrations that can be interpreted as cycles of extension and retraction observed in experiments. Thus, our model is a first step towards a better understanding of the interplay between the transport of vesicles and the spatial organization of cells.","['Cellular automata', 'Lattice-based kinetic models', 'Neurite growth', 'Vesicle transport']","['Automated testing, Data-flow analysis, Process-driven applications']",en

We are able to prove exponential decay towards equilibrium using entropy methods in several situations. As there is no conservation of mass it is difficult to exploit the gradient ow structure of the differential operator which renders the analysis more challenging. In particular, classical logarithmic Sobolev inequalities are not applicable any more.

Notwithstanding, entirely seamless integration of all channels, for example, in terms of customer or pricing data or consistent product offerings, is still a challenging endeavor. Technological developments, such as Industry 4.0 (I4.0), lead to innovation opportunities in the production industry. As there are intersections between I4.0 and Omni-Channel retailing, we propose that prominent Omni-Channel retailing challenges can be overcome by integrating knowledge from both research domains. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to investigate, which I4.0 concepts are utilized in scientific literature to overcome challenges and how these concepts can be transferred to Omni-Channel Management. To make this knowledge tangible for retailers, this article deduces opportunities on the application of I4.0 concepts in Omni-Channel retailing.

After being conditioned by experiences in entertainment or simple Internet search, customers increasingly expect that a smart shopping assistant understands his/her shopping intentions and transfers these to shopping recommendations. Thus, the emerging opportunity in this context is to facilitate an intention-based shopping experience similar to the way semantic search engines provide responses to enquiries. In order to progress this new area, we differentiate alternative types of shopping intentions to provide the first set of conversation patterns. Grounded in the Speech Act Theory and a structured literature review, semantic shopping is defined and different types of shopping intentions are deduced.",,"['Crisis management', ' innovation']",en

It relies mostly on evolutionary and related optimization methods but usually only treats a single of the many available facets as visuals, levels, audio, etc. The problem of how to combine several facets of generation is largely unsolved, but nevertheless very important. One of its subproblems is that we currently do not know in advance how users will react to machine-generated combinations. Based on a simple maze game with exchangeable visuals and audio styles we test how users receive 'usual' and 'unusual' facet compositions by means of rank trace based annotations of their own play-throughs. By means of machine learning techniques, we establish a model in order to learn and predict user reactions. Understanding the effects of facet composition on the user is fundamental if we want to rise evolutionary generation of content to the next level.","['Game facets', 'Procedural content generation', 'User study']",,en

Various studies in the German industry have shown that the majority of companies already follow up on the topic. However, successful implementations of predictive maintenance in businesses are still a rarity. Due to the lack of knowledge and guidance during the implementation process, companies experience many difficulties for the realization of this proactive maintenance approach. Even though much research has been conducted in the fields of predictive maintenance and prognostics and health management, little attention was devoted to the design and analysis of process models for industrial applications. Common process models are theoretically derived without capturing the complexity of reality. This paper communicates the results of interviews conducted with six industry experts. In particular, experts from management consultancies are addressed with experience in multiple successful implementations. Based on the collected data, industry insights in terms of steps and phases of process models, best practices and challenges are provided.","['Expert interviews', 'Industry insights', 'predictive maintenance', 'Process model']",,en

A Critical reflection on Differences in the Treatment of Citizens as 'Users' in e-government Research,"Despite the importance of citizens as users of digital public services,e-government research has not explicitly considered different perspectives oncitizens as users of said services. This paper sets out to explore the possiblevariations in which the citizen as a user of digital public services is conceptualizedwithin the e-government literature. Through a qualitative and interpretiveapproach, we have analysed literature from different fields of e-governmentresearch to create an overview of how citizens as users of digital public servicesare conceptualized in e-government research. The structure of the review departsfrom, and is framed by, four established value paradigms for e-governmentmanagement. Our approach reveals that - depending on the perspective taken -the conceptualization of the citizen varies considerably and, as a consequence,may impact the results and contributions of each research perspective. Theconception of the citizen as a user of digital public services varies from being apassive recipient of government services, to being an active co-producer ofservices. This article contributes to e-government theory by unboxing the conceptionsof citizens as users of digital public services that are existent in currentresearch on digital public services. In providing a framework that relates theseconceptions to previously known value paradigms, the article offers a startingpoint for taking a multidimensional perspective in e-government research thatconsiders the citizen as a multifaceted and heterogeneous entity.",e-government; citizen; user,"['Benchmarking, Instance features, Optimization, Problem generation, Traveling salesperson problem']",en
60526281,Towards Pluri-Platform Development: Evaluating a Graphical Model-Driven Approach to App Development Across Device Classes,"The domain of mobile apps encompasses a fast-changing ecosystem of platforms and vendors in which new classes of heterogeneous app-enabled devices are emerging. To digitize everyday work routines, business apps are used by many non-technical users. However, designing apps is mostly done according to traditional software development practices, and further complicated by the variability of device capabilities. To empower non-technical users to participate in the creation of supportive apps, graphical domain-specific languages can be used. Consequently, we propose the M&uuml;nster App Modeling Language (MAML) to specify business apps through graphical building blocks on a high level of abstraction. In contrast to existing process modelling notations, these models can directly be transformed into apps for multiple platforms across different device classes through code generators without the need for manual programming. To evaluate the comprehensibility and usability of MAML's DSL, two studies were performed with software developers, process modellers, and domain experts.","['Business app', 'Cross-platform', 'Graphical domain-specific language', 'Model-driven software development']",,en

To alleviate this problem, we proposed a Query By Example (QBE) approach powered by intelligent algorithms that discovers database queries from a few tuple examples provided by the user. We investigated the effectiveness of three algorithms, namely, Greedy Search, Genetic Programming, and CART decision trees in discovering queries in two distinct databases. To the best of our knowledge, no other research has focused on the comparative analysis of such algorithms in the context of QBE. Our results show that CART decision trees were capable of discovering the most accurate queries. However, CART tends to produce long queries, which may hinder user interpretation.

Nonintelligent decision support systems (DSS) lack automatic interpretations, at least in a low level scale, which can lead to undesired solutions. To tackle this limitation, hence producing enhanced decision making, a hybrid intelligent decision support approach is presented, which combines case-based reasoning cycle, semiotic concepts, and self-organizing maps. In addition, a novel sign deconstruction mechanism is introduced as foundation of the new approach and affords better interpretability and contextualization of candidate solutions without compromising efficiency and precision. The obtained results confirm that our proposed approach has the potential to be readily applicable to decision problems, particularly the ones that are of subjective nature.

A common problem in clustering is the proper choice of parameter settings. To tackle this, automated algorithm configuration is available which can automatically find the best parameter settings. In practice, however, many of our today’s data sources are data streams due to the widespread deployment of sensors, the internet-of-things or (social) media. Stream clustering aims to tackle this challenge by identifying, tracking and updating clusters over time. Unfortunately, none of the existing approaches for automated algorithm configuration are directly applicable to the streaming scenario. In this paper, we explore the possibility of automated algorithm configuration for stream clustering algorithms using an ensemble of different configurations.

We then exemplarily implement three search algorithms that traverse the search tree on-demand: depth-first search, breadth-first search, and iterative deepening depth-first search. In particular, the last two strategies allow for a complete search, which is novel in constraint-logic object-oriented programming and highlights our main contribution.

60586112,Abusiveness is Non-Binary: Five Shades of Gray in German Online News-Comments,"Online news comment sections face a surge in uncivil, abusive and even straightforwardly hateful and threatening posts. In Germany especially the refugee crisis beginning in 2015 has sparked a lot of controversial and even unacceptable user comments. Overwhelmed by the amount of content and facing the risk of fines and a churn of readers as well as advertisers, many platforms shut down their comment sections as a last resort. To reduce their moderation effort, academics started applying machine learning to classify comments automatically. However, these efforts so far have been mostly focused on English texts. To provide similar systems for German, this paper implements and evaluates six different machine learning classifiers and five different strategies to convert textual comments into machine-compatible vectors. Contrary to common belief in the domain, comments often evade binary classification: Often comments are not only hateful, or insulting or threatening but fall within multiple of these categories. Hence, we will go beyond traditional multi-class classification models and prototypically evaluate the use of multi-label techniques. The first evaluations indicate that systems for abusive language detection are transferable to the German language and that supporting multi-labels might not only help to improve the detection of rare abusiveness types but also lead to a more realistic representation of actual online commentary.","['abusive language', 'hate speech', 'machine learning', 'moderation', 'multi-label']","['acceptance, automatic, comment-moderation, transparency, trust, user posts']",en

60603733,Conceptual Modeling Meets Customer Journey Mapping: Structuring a Tool for Service Innovation,"Customer experience has become the main differentiator for competition in the digital age. Customer Journey Mapping (CJM) is a technique that aims to understand the customer's decision process and experience by taking a customer perspective and modeling his/her different steps. CJM facilitates innovation by proposing new or improved services. In a joint research project, we aimed at creating a CJM approach that allows for the participation of a broad audience in the creation process that especially has no experience in CJM or modeling. When studying the related literature, it becomes clear that methodological guidance in CJM is absent. While there are domain specific modeling languages for CJM, these do not include an overarching framework of how they should be carried out in an organizational setting. In lieu of proposing 'yet another modeling language', we present a framework for CJM that embeds a modeling approach in an overarching method. We utilized the Action Design Research method to tackle our problem with the particular focus on the participation of inexperienced personnel.

The predominant channel-based thinking is superseded by touchpoint-based thinking, which entails a more granular perspective on each customer contact regardless of the communication channel. Interestingly, there exists an analogy between this development and the dissemination of the process-oriented enterprise over the function-oriented enterprise. This article builds on this circumstance and argues for the knowledge transfer from the mature Business Process Management (BPM) domain to the nascent Touchpoint Management (TPM) domain. To substantiate this idea, a theoretical framework is proposed. It is illustrating methods that are deemed useful for TPM in form of four propositions, as well as it clarifies the process of knowledge transfer between BPM and TPM through a research design.",,,en
60619478,Automated Data-flow Analysis and Validation in Process Automation Projects,"Process-driven applications (PDAs) rely on a combination of executable process models and code that implements individual process steps. These step implementations rely on process variables that maintain state across process steps and are used to take decisions on alternative execution paths, i. e. they hold data received from and saved to (external) backend systems. As a result, the data flow of a PDA can become complex even if each step implementation is kept simple. Complexity arises from various possibilities for manipulating process variables, in addition to the variety of execution paths that make it difficult to keep track of process variables. We propose a static analysis approach for managing or reducing complexity by limiting the solution space of implementations. It checks assertions on the data flow in PDAs while taking process variables into account. Assertions are specified using our novel data-flow validation language (DFVL). For demonstration, DFVL and automated assertion checking are implemented as part of an open source process application validation tool. The tool facilitates the use of DFVL for automated static analyses in the same way as unit tests are used for software testing. A short evaluation shows the applicability of our approach and tool.","['Automated testing', 'Data-flow analysis', 'Process-driven applications']","['Business Model Innovation, Business Model Taxonomy, Smart Energy Business Models, Smart Grid Business Models']",en

GMQL queries are formulas and professionals expressed the need to specify queries more conveniently. Therefore, the next development step was DMQL, which comes with functionality similar to GMQL, but allows to specify queries graphically.

No matter if a new software, a new tool, a simple workflow or a broader organizational structure become available, CM organizations need to estimate the potential added value under a high degree of uncertainty. In general, the more reliable information about the new solution is available, the more informed the decisions are. One promising way in assessing the potential impact of new CM solutions can be found through its application in an as realistic as possible and an as secure as necessary setup. However, such artificial scenarios like simulation exercises hold the risk of measuring the performance of the solution itself rather than its contribution to the CM operation. In this paper we review the state of the art in measuring crisis management performance, discuss the results in the context of performance measurement in general and present a performance measurement approach supporting a structured assessment of innovative CM solutions applied within collaborative demonstration project.",Crisis management; innovation,,en

60637728,Understanding Virtual Embodiment: A Phenomenological Lens,"The paper develops a phenomenological perspective on virtual interactions, which focuses on the centrality of the human body for developing meaningful engagements and relationships in virtual settings. From such a stance, the paper problematizes the extant perspectives that are being premised either on the physicality of the human body and thereby face-to-face interactions, or on the negligence of the body and its reduction to digital text in virtual interactions. In contrast, by drawing on the work of Merleau-Ponty, this paper sets a middle ground, which emphasizes the relationship between the phenomenal (lived) body, and the objective (image) body, which also constitutes our engagements with others. The findings of the paper, based on an analysis of an in-depth, longitudinal, exclusively-mediated software development relationship, identify the importance of inter-orienting and inter-presencing practices. These practices show that virtual interactions are qualitatively distinct mode of engagement, which is more-than-linguistic and more-than-task-oriented. This perspective of virtual embodiment is valuable for addressing the research contradictions in the area of virtual interactions, and offering important insights to the recent IS discourse on performativity and ontological inseparability.",,,en

60660130,Time Complexity Analysis of RLS and (1+1) EA for the Edge Coloring Problem,"The edge coloring problem asks for an assignment of colors to edges of a graph such that no two incident edges share the same color and the number of colors is minimized. It is known that all graphs with maximum degree Δ can be colored with Δ or Δ + 1 colors, but it is NP-hard to determine whether Δ colors are sufficient. We present the first runtime analysis of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for the edge coloring problem. Simple EAs such as RLS and (1+1) EA efficiently find (2Δ - 1)-colorings on arbitrary graphs and optimal colorings for even and odd cycles, paths, star graphs and arbitrary trees. A partial analysis for toroids also suggests efficient runtimes in bipartite graphs with many cycles. Experiments support these findings and investigate additional graph classes such as hypercubes, complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs. Theoretical and experimental results suggest that simple EAs find optimal colorings for all these graph classes in expected timeO(Δ∂2m logm), wherem is the number of edges and ∂ is the length of the longest simple path in the graph.","['Edge coloring problem', 'Runtime analysis']","['cold-start problem, Recommender Systems, social communities']",en

Creating a large variety of instances is crucial for successful applications in the blooming field of algorithm selection. In this paper, we introduce new and creative mutation operators for evolving instances of the TSP.We show that adopting those operators in an evolutionary algorithm allows for the generation of benchmark sets with highly desirable properties: (1) novelty by clear visual distinction to established benchmark sets in the field, (2) visual and quantitative diversity in the space of TSP problem characteristics, and (3) significant performance differences with respect to the restart versions of heuristic state-of-the-art TSP solvers EAX and LKH. The important aspect of diversity is addressed and achieved solely by the proposed mutation operators and not enforced by explicit diversity preservation.","['Benchmarking', 'Instance features', 'Optimization', 'Problem generation', 'Traveling salesperson problem']","['IT Artifact', ' Online Experiments', ' Evaluation Platform', ' Versioning']",en

60668489,Mitigating information overload in social media during conflicts and crises: design and evaluation of a cross-platform alerting system,"The research field of crisis informatics examines, amongst others, the potentials and barriers of social media use during conflicts and crises. Social media allow emergency services to reach the public easily in the context of crisis communication and receive valuable information (e.g. pictures) from social media data. However, the vast amount of data generated during large-scale incidents can lead to issues of information overload and quality. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes the semi-automatic creation of alerts including keyword, relevance and information quality filters based on cross-platform social media data. We conducted empirical studies and workshops with emergency services across Europe to raise requirements, then iteratively designed and implemented an approach to support emergency services, and performed multiple evaluations, including live demonstrations and field trials, to research the potentials of social media-based alerts. Finally, we present the findings and implications based on semi-structured interviews with emergency services, highlighting the need for usable configurability and white-box algorithm representation.",Social media; emergency management; social media alerts; information overload; system evaluation,,en

60688241,A Compiler and Virtual Machine for Constraint-logic Object-oriented Programming with Muli,"The development of enterprise software typically relies on object-oriented (OO) programming languages. However, OO languages are not particularly suited for the implementation of software which involves solving complicated search problems with dynamically appearing constraints, e. g. as found in logistics. Aiming to improve this situation, we propose the Münster Logic-imperative Language (Muli). As a constraint-logic OO language, it facilitates an integrated implementation of applications that use aspects from both constraint-logic and object-oriented programming, thus eliminating the need to resort to JNI for the integration of search applications that are written in a (constraint) logic language. Muli extends Java by logic variables and encapsulated search. Its runtime is based on a symbolic Java virtual machine and leverages constraint solvers. Outside of search regions, Muli behaves just like Java. We motivate the benefits of integrating object-oriented programming and constraint-logic programming into a single language and introduce novel concepts that are required for a seamless integration. Furthermore, we present an operational semantics and transfer concepts and semantics into implementations of a compiler and a virtual machine.","['Constraint-logic programming', 'Operational semantics', 'Programming language', 'Programming paradigm integration', 'Virtual machine implementation']",,en
60688331,Simplifying license attribution for OER with emacs-reveal,"Open Educational Resources (OER) come with different license terms that require different forms of attribution. Properly attributing OER with licensing information has previously been identified as one of the most time-consuming factors of OER projects. As shown in this paper, the semantic annotation standard CC REL lacks features that are necessary for correct attribution with popular Creative Commons licenses. The software emacs-reveal addresses this gap in the context of OER slideshows, which may contain figures under different licensing terms: For each figure, a simple text file stores metadata building upon the vocabulary of CC REL (with pragmatic extensions) and can be shared along with the figure. From that metadata, the software generates attribution statements, both in machine-readable form (based on RDFa) and in human-readable form. The novel resulting process avoids manual copying of relevant license information, which is time-consuming and error-prone.",Open Educational Resource; OER; Attribution; Creative Commons; RDFa; FLOSS,"['Biased mutation, Combinatorial optimization, Minimum spanning tree, Multi-objective optimization']",en

60713304,The European Procurement Dilemma—First Steps to Introduce Data-Driven Policy-Making in Public Procurement,"Amounting to 15% of European GDP, public procurement is a substantial policy field in the EU. In view of this economic weight, empirical analyses are necessary as a basis for political decisions that affect the legal regime of procurement. Despite this importance, currently, the EU cannot evaluate policy impacts based on a valid data basis reasoned in the lack of proper information management. Viewing the case of European public procurement, this paper illustrates the relevance and impact of IT-management for economic decision-making. Thereby, the aim of the research is not to analyze and evaluate procurement performance and policies in the EU but showing the importance of a proper and streamlined application of ICT for reasonable decision-making.","['data quality', 'data-driven decision-making', 'e-procurement', 'information management', 'public procurement']",,en

60734692,What is Abusive Language? - Integrating Different Views on Abusive Language for Machine Learning,"Abusive language has been corrupting online conversations since the inception of the internet. Substantial research efforts have been put into the investigation and algorithmic resolution of the problem. Different aspects such as “cyberbullying”, “hate speech” or “profanity” have undergone ample amounts of investigation, however, often using inconsistent vocabulary such as “offensive language” or “harassment”. This led to a state of confusion within the research community. The inconsistency can be considered an inhibitor for the domain: It increases the risk of unintentional redundant work and leads to undifferentiated and thus hard to use and justifiable machine learning classifiers. To remedy this effect, this paper introduces a novel configurable, multi-view approach to define abusive language concepts.","['Abusive language', 'Harassment', 'Hate speech', 'Machine learning', 'Offensive language']",,en
60738355,Can Analytics as a Service Save the Online Discussion Culture? – The Case of Comment Moderation in the Media Industry,"In recent years, online public discussions face a proliferation of racist, politically, and religiously motivated hate comments, threats, and insults. With the failure of purely manual moderation, platform operators started searching for semi-automated or even completely automated approaches for comment moderation. One promising option to (semi-) automate the moderation process is the application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this paper we describe the challenges, that currently prevent the application of these techniques and therefore the development of (semi-) and automated solutions. As most of the challenges (e.g., curation of big datasets) require huge financial investments, only big players, such as Google or Facebook, will be able to invest in them. Many of the smaller and medium-sized internet companies will fall behind. To allow this bulk of (media) companies to stay competitive, we design a novel Analytics as a Service (AaaS) offering that will also allow small and medium sized enterprises to profit from ML decision support. We then use the identified challenges to evaluate the conceptual design of the business model and highlight areas of future research to enable the instantiation of the AaaS platform.","['abusive language', 'business model', 'comment moderation', 'hate speech', 'machine learning', 'moderation']","['Conceptual Modeling', ' Structuring', '']",en

To support decision-makers with adequate IT systems, it is necessary to know which type of information decision-makers need at their workplace. Therefore, our research goal is providing a framework that structures the information needs for decision-makers in large organizations. In this paper, we conduct a structured literature review to find different classifications of information needs. We combine and integrate three well-known frameworks. Our resulting framework consisting of the dimensions scope, time-orientation, abstraction and presentation is evaluated in eleven interviews conducted with managers. This shows that the information categories found in literature can be mapped to the actual information need found in practice.","['Business Information', 'Decision-Makers', 'Framework', 'Information Need', 'Management Information Systems']","['Business process management, icebricks, ISO 9001:2015, Quality management']",en
60738541,Effect of Transparency and Trust on Acceptance of Automatic Online Comment Moderation Systems,"User-generated online comments and posts increasingly contain abusive content that needs moderation from an ethical but also legislative perspective. The amount of comments and the need for moderation in our digital world often overpower the capacity of manual moderation. To remedy this, platforms often adopt semi-automated moderation systems. However, because such systems are typically black boxes, user trust in and acceptance of the system is not easily achieved, as black box systems can be perceived as nontransparent and moderating user comments is easily associated with censorship. Therefore, we investigate the relationship of system transparency through explanations, user trust and system acceptance with an online experiment. Our results show that the transparency of an automatic online comment moderation system is a prerequisite for user trust in the system. However, the objective transparency of the moderation system does not influence the user's acceptance.","['acceptance', 'automatic', 'comment-moderation', 'transparency', 'trust', 'user posts']",,en
60740130,A Recommender System Based on Omni-Channel Customer Data,"Recommender systems aim to provide personalized suggestions to customers which products to buy or services to consume. They can help to increase sales by helping customers discover new and relevant products. Traditionally, recommender systems use the purchase history of a customer, e.g., the purchased quantity or properties of the items. While this allows to build personalized recommendations, it is a very limited view of the problem. Nowadays, extensive information about customers and their personal preferences is available which goes far beyond their purchase behaviour. For example, customers reveal their preferences in social media, by their browsing habits and online search behaviour or their interest in specific newsletters. In this paper, we investigate how information from different sources and channels can be collected and incorporated into the recommendation process. We demonstrate this, based on a real-life case study of a retailer with several million transactions. We discuss how to employ a recommender system in this scenario, evaluate various recommendation strategies and describe how to incorporate information from different sources and channels, both internal and external. Our results show that the recommendations can be better tailored to the personal preferences of customers.","['Machine Learning', 'Omni-Channel', 'Recommender Systems']","['group interactions, interpersonal circumplex, personality psychology, small groups, Social behavior']",en
60741026,Semi-automatic inductive construction of reference process models that represent best practices in public administrations: A method,"Business process management often uses reference models to improve processes or as starting point when creating individual process models. The current academic literature offers primarily deductive methods with which to develop these reference models, although some methods develop reference models inductively from a set of individual process models, focusing on deriving and representing common practices. However, there is no inductive method with which to detect best practices and represent them in a reference model. This paper addresses this research gap by proposing a method by which to develop reference process models that represent best practices in public administrations semi-automatically and inductively. The method uses a merged model that retains the structure of the source models while detecting their common parts. It identifies best practices using query constructs and ranking criteria to group the source models’ elements and to evaluate these groups. We provide a conceptualization of the method and demonstrate its functionality using an artificial example. We describe our implementation of the method in a software prototype and report on its evaluation in a workshop with domain and method experts who applied the method to real-world process models.","['Benchmarking', 'E-government', 'Model querying', 'Process management', 'Process model merge', 'Process modeling', 'Public administration', 'Reference modeling']","['Algorithmic Skeletons, Domain-Specific Language, High Performance Computing, High-level Parallel Programming']",en

Due to Information and Communication Technology, current students who are also called digital natives, have a high level of autonomy in performing their study related tasks. However, they also face challenges like being permanently online that lead to increased stress levels. Since previous research has identified time management as a coping strategy for stress, we suggest that it is helpful for students in the digital society. Based on a survey encompassing 51 students, the present study examines the impact of time management on perceived stress and psychological well-being. Our data shows that time management positively predicts psychological well-being. Surprisingly, the data does not reveal any relationship between time management and perceived stress. This study is the first to examine IS students as representatives for digital natives in the context of time management and its relation to stress and well-being. Our findings suggest that universities should account for stressors of the digital society and should include time management modules for encouraging higher levels of health among students.",time management; stress; psychological well-being; students,,en

60755643,Understanding Services in the Era of the Internet of Things: A Smart Service Taxonomy,"In recent years, the “Internet of Things” with so called “smart products” has obtained increasing popularity in both practice and research. By building on the capabilities of smart products, services transform to “smart services” emphasizing the value smart products can provide and how it is co-created. Even though first attempts have been conducted to conceptualize and classify smart services, there seems to be no overall consensus on the specific characteristics of smart services, which different forms they can take on and how different smart services can be described. For example, existing research on smart services does not always consider the common service design elements “service content” and “service delivery”. To address this shortcoming, we develop a taxonomy of smart services by applying extant literature. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our taxonomy by classifying 50 empirical objects and presenting three cases. As a contribution, the paper enhances the understanding of the notion of smart services and strengthens the conceptual foundation for future smart service research.","['Intelligent Services', 'Internet of Things', 'Smart Products', 'Smart Services', 'Taxonomy']",,en

The use of smart energy products like smart meters promises new customer values and opens up potentials for business transformation. Against this background, traditional business models (BMs) along the energy value chain such as those of established energy utilities are challenged by a gradual shift in the energy production paradigm. Consumers can optimize their consumption and become prosumers by generating their own decentralized energy based on smart energy technologies. To capitalize on this development, businesses require an understanding of new business options and ways to exploit smart technologies. Based on both empirical and conceptual sources, we develop a taxonomy that provides a comprehensive overview of smart energy BMs. The taxonomy supports business leaders to describe and analyze important elements of smart energy BMs addressing residential customers. With new configurations of those elements, it serves as a stimulus to innovate traditional offerings along the energy value chain. Moreover, we add descriptive knowledge to the field of domain-specific IoT BMs and strengthen the conceptual fundament of smart energy BMs for future research.","['Business Model Innovation', 'Business Model Taxonomy', 'Smart Energy Business Models', 'Smart Grid Business Models']",,en

One approach to overcome these issues is based on algorithmic skeletons. These are predefined patterns which are implemented in parallel and can be composed by application programmers without taking care of low-level programming aspects. Support for algorithmic skeletons is typically provided as a library. However, optimizations are hard to implement in this setting and programming might still be tedious because of required boiler plate code. Thus, we propose a domain-specific language for algorithmic skeletons that performs optimizations and generates low-level C++ code. Our experimental results on four benchmarks show that the models are significantly shorter and that the execution time and speedup of the generated code often outperform equivalent library implementations using the Muenster Skeleton Library.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'Domain-specific language', 'High-performance computing', 'Model-driven development', 'Parallel programming']",,en

60783161,Making a Case for (Hyper-)Parameter Tuning as Benchmark Problems,"One of the biggest challenges in evolutionary computation concerns the selection and configuration of a best-suitable heuristic for a given problem. While in the past both of these problems have primarily been addressed by building on experts' experience, the last decade has witnessed a significant shift towards automated decision making, which capitalizes on techniques proposed in the machine learning literature. A key success factor in automated algorithm selection and configuration are good training sets, whose performance data can be leveraged to build accurate performance prediction models. With the long-term goal to build landscape-aware parameter control mechanisms for iterative optimization heuristics, we consider in this discussion paper the question how well the 24 functions from the BBOB test bed cover the characteristics of (hyper-)parameter tuning problems. To this end, we perform a preliminary landscape analysis of two hyper-parameter selection problems, and compare their feature values with those of the BBOB functions. While we do see a good fit for one of the tuning problems, our findings also indicate that some parameter tuning problems might not be very well represented by the BBOB functions. This raises the question if one can nevertheless deduce reliable performance-prediction models for hyper-parameter tuning problems from the BBOB test bed, or whether for this specific target the BBOB benchmark should be adjusted, by adding or replacing some of its functions. Independently of the aspect of training automated algorithm selection and configuration techniques, hyper-parameter tuning problems offer a plethora of problems which might be worthwhile to study in the context of benchmarking iterative optimization heuristics.",,,en
60783251,Exploring the MLDA Benchmark on the Nevergrad Platform,"This work presents the integration of the recently released benchmark suite MLDA into Nevergrad, a likewise recently released platform for derivative-free optimization. Benchmarking evolutionary and other optimization methods on this collection enables us to learn how algorithms deal with problems that are often treated by means of standard methods like clustering or gradient descent. As available computation power nowadays allows for running much 'slower' methods without noticing a performance difference it is an open question which of these standard methods may be replaced by derivative-free and (in terms of quality) better performing optimization algorithms. Additionally, most MLDA problems are suitable for landscape analysis and other means of understanding problem difficulty or algorithm behavior, due to their tangible nature. We present the open-source reimplementation of MLDA inside the Nevergrad platform and further discuss some first findings, which result from exploratory experiments with this platform. These include superior performance of advanced quasi-random sequences in some highly multimodal cases (even in non-parallel optimization), great performance of CMA for the perceptron and the Sammon tasks, success of DE on clustering problems, and straightforward implementations of highly competitive algorithm selection models by means of competence maps.","['Benchmarking', 'Machine Learning', 'Open source', 'Optimization']",,en

Boundaries between devices blur with PC-tablet hybrids on the one side and wearables on the other. Future apps need to support a host of app-enabled devices with differing capabilities, along with their software ecosystems. Prior work on cross-platform app development concerned concepts and prototypes, and compared approaches that target smartphones. To aid choosing an appropriate framework and to support the scientific assessment of approaches, an up-to-date comparison framework is needed. Extending work on a holistic, weighted set of assessment criteria, we propose what could become the definitive framework for evaluating cross-platform approaches. We have based it on sound abstract concepts that allow extensions. The weighting capabilities offer customisation to avoid the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges lurking in the variety of available frameworks. Moreover, it advises on multiple development situations based on a single assessment. In this article, we motivate and describe our evaluation criteria. We then present a study that assesses several frameworks and compares them to Web Apps and native development.

In this work, we consider alternative visualizations based on ideas that users often encounter in their daily lives. We explore gamification and peer-pressure as motivators, and test strength meters using badges and high scores based on a reward system similar to what typical video games offer. For a baseline, we consider a classical bar meter, as well as a control group without any strength meter. To evaluate the impact of these meters on the password strength, we performed a user study with 302 participants and a between-subjects design.

60809427,We Value Your Privacy… Now Take Some Cookies: Measuring the GDPR’s Impact on Web Privacy,"<p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018. Its privacy regulations apply to any service and company collecting or processing personal data in Europe. Many companies had to adjust their data handling processes, consent forms, and privacy policies to comply with the GDPR’s transparency requirements. We monitored this rare event by analyzing changes on popular websites in all 28 member states of the European Union. For each country, we periodically examined its 500 most popular websites – 6,579 in total – for the presence of and updates to their privacy policy between December 2017 and October 2018. While many websites already had privacy policies, we find that in some countries up to 15.7 % of websites added new privacy policies by May 25, 2018, resulting in 84.5% of websites having privacy policies. 72.6 % of websites with existing privacy policies updated them close to the date. After May this positive development slowed down noticeably. Most visibly, 62.1 % of websites in Europe now display cookie consent notices, 16 % more than in January 2018. These notices inform users about a site’s cookie use and user tracking practices. We categorized all observed cookie consent notices and evaluated 28 common implementations with respect to their technical realization of cookie consent. Our analysis shows that core web security mechanisms such as the same-origin policy pose problems for the implementation of consent according to GDPR rules, and opting out of third-party cookies requires the third party to cooperate. Overall, we conclude that the web became more transparent at the time GDPR came into force, but there is still a lack of both functional and usable mechanisms for users to consent to or deny processing of their personal data on the Internet.</p>",Privacy policy; GDPR,,en
60813101,"Intentional Forgetting in Socio-Digital Work Systems: System Characteristics and User-related Psychological Consequences on Emotion, Cognition, and Behavior","Future work environments will offer technical applications to manage increasing amounts of information for organizations, teams, and individuals. In this context, psychological concepts of intentional forgetting (IF) can be applied to improve the performance of work systems or to extend the cognitive capacities of humans in technical systems. Different IF mechanisms have been suggested for assisting technology-aided IF, such as: (1) filtering of irrelevant or distressful information (e.g., by suppressing, deleting, or selecting), (2) delegating tasks from human to digital agents, changing roles, and reorganizing socio-digital work systems, or (3) systematic (re-)placement of retrieval cues or triggers to generate or suppress behavior. Due to these different underlying IF mechanisms, the implementation of IF at the individual, team, and organizational level will differ substantially between work areas or systems. In order to gain a better understanding of how socio-digital applications of IF impact human behavior and reactions, it is necessary to differentiate between relevant characteristics of socio-digital IF systems and gain an understanding of how these characteristics impact users' attitudes and performance. Thus, the present paper aims to classify and compare these characteristics of different applications of IF and introduces variables and methods to study psychological effects on users' behavior, experience, and affective reactions.",Intentional Forgetting; cognitive capacity; transactive memory systems; unlearning of routine; user experience,"['Authorization, Cryptography, Electronic health records']",en
60814208,Enhancing Traditional Recommender Systems via Social Communities,"Collaborative Filtering (CF) has become the most popular approach for developing Recommender Systems in diverse business applications. Unfortunately, problems such as the cold-start problem (i.e., new users or items enter the system and for those no previous preference information is available) and the gray sheep problem (i.e., cases in which a user profile does not match any other profile in the user community) are widely recognized for hindering recommendation effectiveness of traditional CF methods. To alleviate such problems, substantial research has focused on enhancing CF with social information about users (e.g., social relationships and communities). However, despite the crescent interest in social-based approaches, researches and practitioners face the challenge of developing their own Recommender System architecture for appropriately combining social and collaborative filtering methods to improve recommendation results. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a flexible architecture to support researchers and practitioners in the task of designing real-world Recommender Systems that exploit social network data. We focus on detailing our proposed architecture modules and their interplay, potential algorithms for extracting and combining relevant social information, and candidate technologies for handling diverse and massive data volumes. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on alleviating the cold-start problem over a concrete experimental case.","['cold-start problem', 'Recommender Systems', 'social communities']",,en

In light of recent public scandals in areas such as social media, car manufacturing or financial services, organizations require an understanding of how customer trust can be managed using contemporary information systems solutions. In this paper we propose trust management as an IS theme of increasing relevance and draw upon extant research in IS, psychology, and marketing to bridge the gap between topics such as risk management, compliance management and governance on the one hand and trust management on the other. We utilize Botsman's concept of uncertainty as a proxy for customer trust to bring together organizational approaches that can objectively reduce uncertainty linked to an organization, its processes, products, and services with the customer's perception of this uncertainty. We contribute to the further maturity of trust management by providing new foundations and providing explicit advice on how to improve trust in organizations.",Trust; Uncertainty; Artifact; Management; Information Systems,,en

60869153,Decoupling Language and Editor - The Impact of the Language Server Protocol on Textual Domain-Specific Languages,"Model-Driven Software Development using Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) has been widely adopted throughout research and industry. The language workbenches required to efficiently build Domain-Specific Languages and the associated editor support are often deeply integrated into a specific Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Thereby, the chosen Domain-Specific Language workbench predicts the IDE required to use the DSL. Yet, this IDE might not be the best choice for further implementing, testing, and debugging the generated code. A case study was conducted to analyze how the Language Server Protocol could be utilized to decouple the DSL implementation from a specific editor integrated into an IDE. First, the Language Server Protocol capabilities are exemplified by building editor support for an Entity-DSL that is integrated into two different IDEs. Second, a SWOT analysis is carried out to identify strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and threats for Domain-Specific Languages utilizing the Language Server Protocol. The case study's results indicate that the Language Server Protocol enables efficient multi-editor integration. Further, the results of the SWOT analysis imply potential benefits for cross-functional teams specifying a shared domain model.","['Case Study', 'Language Server Protocol', 'Model-Driven Development', 'Textual Domain-Specific Languages']",,en

60900819,On the Benefits of Biased Edge-Exchange Mutation for the Multi-Criteria Spanning Tree Problem,"Research has shown that for many single-objective graph problems where optimum solutions are composed of low weight sub-graphs, such as the minimum spanning tree problem (MST), mutation operators favoring low weight edges show superior performance. Intuitively, similar observations should hold for multi-criteria variants of such problems. In this work, we focus on the multi-criteria MST problem. A thorough experimental study is conducted where we estimate the probability of edges being part of non-dominated spanning trees as a function of the edges' non-domination level or domination count, respectively. Building on gained insights, we propose several biased one-edge-exchange mutation operators that differ in the used edge-selection probability distribution (biased towards edges of low rank). Our empirical analysis shows that among different graph types (dense and sparse) and edge weight types (both uniformly random and combinations of Euclidean and uniformly random) biased edge-selection strategies perform superior in contrast to the baseline uniform edge-selection. Our findings are in particular strong for dense graphs.","['Biased mutation', 'Combinatorial optimization', 'Minimum spanning tree', 'Multi-objective optimization']","['Cold-start problem, Collaborative filtering, Recommender system, Social networks, User profile']",en

We consider the classical graph coloring problem and investigate the dynamic setting where edges are added to the current graph. We then analyze the expected time for randomized search heuristics to recompute high quality solutions. This includes the (1+1) EA and RLS in a setting where the number of colors is bounded and we are minimizing the number of conflicts as well as iterated local search algorithms that use an unbounded color palette and aim to use the smallest colors and - as a consequence - the smallest number of colors. We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or even harder than optimization from scratch, i. e. starting with a random initialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems. However, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for others. In most cases our bounds show that reoptimization is faster than optimizing from scratch. Furthermore, we show how to speed up computations by using problem specific operators concentrating on parts of the graph where changes have occurred.","['Dynamic optimization', 'Evolutionary algorithms', 'Running time analysis', 'Theory']","['cold-start problem, Recommender Systems, social communities']",en

While the world is becoming increasingly complex, and a growing number of disciplines are evolving to help make it a better place, structure is what is needed in order to understand and combine the various perspectives and approaches involved. Structure is the essential component that allows us to bridge the gaps between these different worlds, and offers a medium for communication and exchange.</p><p>The contributions in this book build these bridges, which are vital in order to communicate between different worlds of thought and methodology – be it between Information Systems (IS) research and practice, or between IS research and other research disciplines. They describe how structuring can be and should be done so as to foster communication and collaboration. The topics covered reflect various layers of structure that can serve as bridges: models, processes, data, organizations, and technologies. In turn, these aspects are complemented by visionary outlooks on how structure influences the field. <br /></p>",Conceptual Modeling; Structuring;,"['Information Management', ' Information Infrastructure', ' Information Function', ' Information Technology', ' Information System', ' Information Resource', ' Business Administration', ' Computer Science', ' Information Sciences', ' Communication Sciences', ' Engeneering']",en
60943580,Structuring Quality Management with the icebricks Business Process Management Approach,"Quality Management (QM) is of great importance to enterprises nowadays. Especially with respect to reputation, a proper QM can yield enormous benefits. Therefore, achieving a QM certification, e.g. with the ISO 9001:2015 certificate, helps to communicate the own, high quality standards to the customers. Although the ISO 9001, a well-known standard for QM, is strictly process-oriented as of the 2015-version-in contrast to the 2008-version, which focussed on the existence of a quality handbook-Business Process Management (BPM) is rarely seen as a perfect fit for QM. Therefore, we propose using the well-established BPM approach icebricks to facilitate an effective and efficient QM including its documentation. With the help of the icebricks process modelling tool, a complete ISO 9001 certification process can be implemented. Moreover, we show that there is added value that entails the pure process repositories created for documentation purposes, thus, such a certification is not done to no end and out of reputational reasons only.","['Business process management', 'icebricks', 'ISO 9001:2015', 'Quality management']","['Digitalization', ' Digital Transformation', ' Digital Strategy', ' IT/IS Strategy']",en

It allows to code and rate individual behaviors across seven behavioral domains (expressiveness, dominance, arrogance, warmth, aggressiveness, negative affect behavior, intellectual competence behavior), three behavioral channels (verbal, paraverbal, nonverbal), and three levels of abstraction (macro-, meso-, micro-level). Moreover, M-BeCoSy is available in different versions with each capturing behavioral domains and channels in different levels of detail. Its modular composition allows for tailored analyses of individual differences in a variety of group interaction contexts, e.g., small group research in developmental, educational, personality, and social psychology as well as professional contexts such as assessments, leadership coaching, team diagnostics in organizations, counseling, and educational environments.","['group interactions', 'interpersonal circumplex', 'personality psychology', 'small groups', 'Social behavior']","['Automatic assessment, Design patterns, Formative e-assessment, UML class diagrams']",en
60960846,Musket: A Domain-Specific Language for High-Level Parallel Programming with Algorithmic Skeletons,"Parallel programming for an infrastructure of multi-core or many-core clusters is a challenge for developers without experience in this domain. Developers need to use several libraries such as MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA to efficiently use the hardware which may include additional accelerators such as GPUs. Also, performing low-level optimizations is required in order to reach high performance. One approach to overcome these issues is the concept of Algorithmic Skeletons. These are instances of typical patterns for parallel programming, such as map, fold, and zip, which can simply be composed by an application programmer without taking care of low-level programming aspects. We propose a domain-specific language called Musket that includes algorithmic skeletons as domain abstractions which seamlessly integrate with sequential code while aligning with the C++ programming language for fast learnability. For improved usability, the editing component validates the correctness of models and provides solution hints in the integrated development environment. From the naïve program specification, automatic transformations are applied in order to optimize the code for parallel execution. Subsequently, low-level C++ programs are generated which are optimized for multi-core parallelism on a cluster infrastructure. We evaluate the language using benchmark models written in our DSL and compare the execution time and speedup achieved through model preprocessing and code generation. Our experimental results show that the performance of Musket programs can be significantly improved through intermediate optimizations. The DSL approach thus simplifies multi-core application development and enables performance optimizations through model transformations.","['Algorithmic Skeletons', 'Domain-Specific Language', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-level Parallel Programming']",,en

Existing and widely used CAPTCHA schemes are based on visual puzzles that are hard to solve on mobile devices with a limited screen. We propose to leverage movement data from hardware sensors to build a CAPTCHA scheme suitable for mobile devices. Our approach is based on human motion information and the scheme requires users to perform gestures from everyday life (e. g., hammering where the smartphone should be imagined as a hammer and the user has to hit a nail five times). We implemented a prototype of the proposed method and report findings from a comparative usability study with 50 participants. The results suggest that our scheme outperforms other competing schemes on usability metrics such as solving time, accuracy, and error rate. Furthermore, the results of the user study indicate that gestures are a suitable input method to solve CAPTCHAs on (mobile) devices with smaller screens and hardware sensors.","['CAPTCHAs', 'Device sensors', 'Motion-based liveliness test']","['Competences, EGovernment, Public Sector, Roles']",en

60976832,Hell of a Handshake: Abusing TCP for Reflective Amplification DDoS Attacks.,"Nowadays, a common way for attackers to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks is via so called amplification attacks. The basic idea is to send relatively small requests with spoofed source address to public hosts (e.g., NTP servers), which reflect significantly larger responses to the victim of the attack. Recent studies focused on UDP-based attacks and analyzed the attack surface in detail. First results also suggested that TCP-based protocols are in principle vulnerable to such attacks, despite the three-way-handshake mechanism. In this paper, we continue this line of work and demonstrate that TCP protocols indeed can be abused in practice. More specifically, we show that the handshake itself often yields amplification, especially since a lot of devices on the Internet react in unforeseen ways during the connection establishment. To estimate the landscape of Internet devices vulnerable to TCP amplification attacks, we performed Internet-wide scans for common TCP-based protocols and identified thousands of amplifiers that allow an amplification of factor 50x and higher.",,"['Directed forgetting', ' Decision making', ' Knowledge Management', ' Trust', ' Well-being']",en
60976923,Going wild: Large-scale classification of open DNS resolvers,"Since several years, millions of recursive DNS resolvers are - deliberately or not - open to the public. This, however, is counter-intuitive, since the operation of such openly accessible DNS resolvers is necessary in rare cases only. Furthermore, open resolvers enable both amplification DDoS and cache snooping attacks, and can be abused by attackers in multiple other ways. We thus find open recursive DNS resolvers to remain one critical phenomenon on the Internet. In this paper, we illuminate this phenomenon by analyzing it from two different angles. On the one hand, we study the landscape of DNS resolvers based on empirical data we collected for over a year. We analyze the changes over time and classify the resolvers according to device type and software version. On the other hand, we take the viewpoint of a client and measure the response authenticity of these resolvers. Besides legitimate redirections (e.g., to captive portals or router login pages), we find millions of resolvers to deliberately manipulate DNS resolutions (i.e., return bogus IP address information). To understand this threat in more detail, we systematically analyze non-legitimate DNS responses and reveal open DNS resolvers that manipulate DNS resolutions to censor communication channels, inject advertisements, serve malicious files, perform phishing, or redirect to other kinds of suspicious or malicious activities.","['Agglomerative hierarchical clustering', 'Content delivery network', 'DNS resolution paths', 'Domain name system']","['Constraint-logic object-oriented programming, Free objects, Multi-paradigm languages, Object type constraints']",en

60977383,An Empirical Study on Online Price Differentiation,"Price differentiation describes a marketing strategy to determine the price of goods on the basis of a potential customer’s attributes like location, financial status, possessions, or behavior. Several cases of online price differentiation have been revealed in recent years. For example, different pricing based on a user’s location was discovered for online office supply chain stores and there were indications that offers for hotel rooms are priced higher for Apple users compared to Windows users at certain online booking websites. One potential source for relevant distinctive features are system fingerprints, i. e., a technique to recognize users’ systems by identifying unique attributes such as the source IP address or system configuration. In this paper, we shed light on the ecosystem of pricing at online platforms and aim to detect if and how such platform providers make use of price differentiation based on digital system fingerprints. We designed and implemented an automated price scanner capable of disguising itself as an arbitrary system, leveraging real-world system fingerprints, and searched for price differences related to different features (e. g., user location, language setting, or operating system). This system allows us to explore price differentiation cases and identify those characteristic features of a system that may influence a product’s price.",,"['Omni-Channel Management', ' Entity-Relationship-Modell', ' Customer Experience', ' Management']",en

Based on these results, we then collaborated with the security community in a large-scale campaign to reduce the number of vulnerable NTP servers by more than 92%. To assess possible next steps of attackers, we evaluate amplification vulnerabilities in the TCP handshake and show that attackers can abuse millions of hosts to achieve 20x amplification.

In this paper, we propose to integrate pressure-sensitive touchscreen interactions into knowledge-based authentication schemes.

60977755,Tactile One-Time Pad: Leakage-Resilient Authentication for Smartphones,"Nowadays, Smartphones are widely used and they have a growing market share of already more than 55% according to recent studies. They often contain sensitive or private data that can easily be accessed by an attacker if the device is unlocked. Since smartphones are mobile and used as everyday gadgets, they are susceptible to get lost or stolen. To prevent the data from being accessed by an attacker, access control mechanisms like user authentication are needed. However, commonly used authentication mechanisms like PINs, passwords, and patterns suffer from the same weakness: They are vulnerable against different kinds of attacks, most notably shoulder surfing. In order to prevent shoulder surfing, a secure channel between the smartphone and the user must be established that cannot be eavesdropped by an adversary. In this paper, we concentrate on the smartphone’s tactile feedback to add a new security layer to the plain PIN-based authentication mechanism. The key idea is to use vibrations as an additional channel to complement PINs with a tactile one-time pattern. To calibrate the usability of our approach, we developed a game that more than 220 participants played to determine the shortest vibration duration most people can sense. In a security evaluation, we recorded the acoustical signal of the vibration motor of five different smartphones at four different locations with a high-end microphone to cross-correlate a login scenario with a pre-recorded acoustical fingerprint of the devices. Our evaluation results demonstrate that it is not possible for an attacker to spot the user’s secret under normal conditions, e. g., in a restaurant or during a conversation, even with professional equipment. Finally, we show that the required overhead of our approach is reasonable in practice and outperforms prior work.","['Authentication', 'Computer security', 'Human computer interaction', 'Smartphone security', 'Tactile feedback']","['Behavior-Driven Development, Domain-specific language, GUI Test Case Generation, Model-Driven Engineering']",en

60978028,Flexible patient-controlled security for electronic health records,"Electronic health records (EHR) are a convenient method to exchange medical information of patients between different healthcare providers. In many countries privacy laws require to protect the confidentiality of these data records and let the patient control the access to them. Existing approaches to protect the privacy of EHRs are either insufficient for these strict laws or they are too restrictive in their usage. For example, smartcard-based encryption systems require the patient to be always present to authorize access to medical records. However, this does not allow a physician to access an EHR of a patient who is unable to show up in person. In this paper, we propose a security architecture for EHR infrastructures that provides more flexibility but retains the security of patient-controlled encryption. In our proposal patients are able to authorize access to their records remotely (e.g. via phone) and time-independent for later processing by the physician. The security of our approach relies on modern cryptographic schemes and their incorporation into an EHR infrastructure. The adoption of our security architecture would allow to fulfill strict privacy laws while relaxing usage restrictions of existing security protections.

However, finding and purchasing data suitable for a specific purpose and addressing unique (and sometimes) personal requirements is still a challenge. Alternative solutions to the traditional data commerce, the data marketplaces, are of almost no help for novice buyers, as the number of datasets that are available to purchase is often massive. To alleviate this problem, we consider an intelligent decision support approach for helping buyers, particularly inexperienced ones, to better search and evaluate data offerings. The contribution of this work consists of a preference recommendation strategy that focuses a buyer's attention towards more appropriate offers while enhancing his or her awareness of the market. An experimental case is designed to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.

Our framework is composed of three modules, namely, a User Clustering module, a Representative module, and an Adaption module. The User Clustering module aims to find groups of users, the Representative module is responsible for determining a representative of each group, and the Adaption module handles new users and assigns them appropriately.

61003705,Enhancing Traditional Recommender Systems via Social Communities,"Collaborative Filtering (CF) has become the most popular approach for developing Recommender Systems in diverse business applications. Unfortunately, problems such as the cold-start problem (i.e., new users or items enter the system and for those no previous preference information is available) and the gray sheep problem (i.e., cases in which a user profile does not match any other profile in the user community) are widely recognized for hindering recommendation effectiveness of traditional CF methods. To alleviate such problems, substantial research has focused on enhancing CF with social information about users (e.g., social relationships and communities). However, despite the crescent interest in social-based approaches, researches and practitioners face the challenge of developing their own Recommender System architecture for appropriately combining social and collaborative filtering methods to improve recommendation results. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a flexible architecture to support researchers and practitioners in the task of designing real-world Recommender Systems that exploit social network data. We focus on detailing our proposed architecture modules and their interplay, potential algorithms for extracting and combining relevant social information, and candidate technologies for handling diverse and massive data volumes. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on alleviating the cold-start problem over a concrete experimental case.","['cold-start problem', 'Recommender Systems', 'social communities']","['Process-Driven Application', ' Business Process', ' BPM', ' BPMN', ' Static Analysis', ' Verification', '']",en

We conducted an online experiment with 307 participants to test the effect of transparency on users&rsquo; decisions about and comprehension of the requested permission. The results indicate increased comprehension of data processing practices when privacy policies are transparently disclosed, whereas acceptance rates do not vary significantly. We condense our findings into principles that service providers can apply to design privacy-transparent mobile apps.",Mobile privacy decision making; Transparency; EU General Data Protection Regulation; Privacy notice; Consent; Experimental research,"['Automatic assessment', ' Design patterns', ' Formative e-assessment', ' UML class diagrams']",en

61011722,How Management Consultancies Make Sense of Digital Strategy,"Digital technologies are increasingly shaping our lives. They have become an integral part of many products and services, have changed the way companies interact with their customers, and have even opened up new business opportunities that challenge contemporary business models. The impact of digitalization is so fundamental that researchers demand strategic responses. For this purpose, they have introduced a new concept to the academic debate often referred to as “digital strategy”. However, beyond basic assumptions, there is not much consensus on what a digital strategy is. At the same time, management consultancies have made digitalization a core concern and use the notion of a digital strategy extensively. Hence, given the nascent state of research, we have taken a systematic look at how management consultancies make sense of the concept drawing on empirical content analysis. Our analysis revealed a couple of definitional characteristics as well as four prevailing ways of looking at digital strategy: (1) the strategy level, (2) the strategy governance (3) the devices of manifestation and (4) the strategizing logic. Our research contributes to the academic debate by providing a fresh look at how management consultancies make sense of digital strategy as well as the assumptions consultancies make about their development.",Digitalization; Digital Transformation; Digital Strategy; IT/IS Strategy,,en

Students are tasked to model a UML class diagram for a use case, while choosing a suitable design pattern. The web-based tool is able to automatically assess student solutions and identify the design pattern they applied. This information is then used to advise students on their design pattern choice and give further feedback centred towards an exemplary solution. The paper outlines the applied algorithms for the identification process. Further, we analyse the performance of the design pattern identification based on a field experiment within a CS3 course. In the evaluation, we draw the comparison of our tool's identification quality with that of teachers from the CS3 class. Our results show that the approach is reasonable and helpful for students in order to learn how to select and apply design patterns in different scenarios.","['Automatic assessment', 'Design patterns', 'Formative e-assessment', 'UML class diagrams']","['indoor positioning', ' Gaussian processes', ' crowd flow analysis', ' machine learning', ' WiFi']",en

Until now, multi- or cross-platform approaches are usually limited to different platforms for smartphones and tablets. With the recent trend towards app-enabled mobile devices, a plethora of heterogeneous devices such as smartwatches and smart TVs continues to emerge. For app developers, the situation resembles the early days of smartphones but worsened by the widely differing hardware, platform capabilities, and usage patterns. In order to tackle the identified challenges of app development beyond the boundaries of individual device classes, a systematic process built on the model-driven paradigm is presented. In addition, we demonstrate its applicability using the MAML framework to create interoperable business apps for both smartphones and smartwatches from a common, platform-independent model.",,,en

As a potential support strategy, this study examined &lsquo;directed forgetting'(Bjork, 1970) in a simulated sales planning scenario. We assumed that the availability of acomputer-based decision support system (DSS) triggers forgetting of decision-relatedbackground information. Such directed forgetting should not only release memory capacitiesfor additional tasks but also enhance decision quality and decrease strain of decision makers.Assumptions were tested in an experimental study with N = 90 participants. Consistent withour assumptions, results revealed higher recall of decision-unrelated information, higherdecision quality, and higher well-being when participants could use a DSS as compared totwo control conditions without a DSS. Moreover, directed forgetting effects were qualified byparticipants' trust in the DSS.

The availability of object-oriented features calls for the option to use objects as logic variables as well, as opposed to being limited to primitive type logic variables. The present work contributes a concept for reference type logic variables in constraint-logic object-oriented programming that takes arbitrary class hierarchies of programs written in object-oriented languages into account. The concept discusses interactions between constraint-logic object-oriented programs and reference type logic variables, particularly invocations on and access to logic variables, type operations, and equality. Furthermore, it proposes approaches as to how these interactions can be handled by a corresponding execution environment.","['Constraint-logic object-oriented programming', 'Free objects', 'Multi-paradigm languages', 'Object type constraints']",,en

Der Hauptvorteil wird generell jedoch in der Vermeidung des CO2‐Ausstoßes durch die Substitution von fossilen Brennstoffen durch elektrischen Strom gesehen. Elektromobilität ist jedoch nur dann eine saubere und umweltfreundliche Art der Fortbewegung, wenn der benötigte Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien, wie zum Beispiel Solar oder Windkraft, stammt. In Deutschland wurden im Jahr 2016 29,5 % des Stroms aus erneuerbaren Energiequellen erzeugt und dieser Anteil soll bis 2025 auf 40–45 % steigen (Strom‐Report 2016). Elektrofahrzeuge in Deutschland fahren heute also mit Strom, der noch zu rund 70 % aus konventionellen Quellen (fossile Brennstoffe, Kernenergie) stammt und tragen entsprechend indirekt zu CO2‐Emissionen bei. So beträgt der CO2‐Ausstoß des Nissan Leaf, einem derzeit sehr beliebten Elektrofahrzeug, im deutschen Strommix noch immer ca. 106 g/km (Schwarzer 2014).

The Horizon 2020 EQUAL-IST project (&ldquo;Gender Equality Plans for Information Sciences and Technology Research Institutions&rdquo;) supports six Informatics and Information Systems Departments at universities across Europe to initiate the design and implementation of GEPs. This paper is focused on project outcomes of the first iteration of GEP implementation (October 2017 - May 2018). Based on the internal reports provided by the involved research institutions, we classified the implemented actions as &lsquo;structural change actions&rsquo; or &lsquo;preparatory actions&rsquo; (following the study by Sangiuliano, Canali &amp; Madesi, 2018) and as &lsquo;internally-oriented actions&rsquo; or &lsquo;externally-oriented actions&rsquo;. The implemented actions were analyzed across such intervention areas as Institutional Communication, Human Resources and Management Practices, and Teaching and Services for (Potential) Students. The conducted study addresses the need to investigate the peculiarities of GEP implementation in the Information Sciences and Technology (IST) and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) disciplines, where the gender leak in the recruitment pipeline often starts at universities already, with extremely low numbers of enrolled female students. We therefore aim at understanding if the notable amount of actions to attract more female students, which were initiated within the EQUAL-IST project during the first iteration of GEP implementation, implies a risk to bend the process towards more externally-oriented actions, which are less likely to impact internal power structures, at least in the short run. The second purpose of the paper is to explore, whether structural change actions, which have the potential to go beyond mere raising awareness on the topics at stake, tend to be concentrated in the Human Resources and Management Practices area.",Gender Equality Plans (GEPs); structural changes; research organizations; implementation; Information Sciences and Technology; sustainability,,en

61057348,From one-stop shop to no-stop shop: An e-government stage model,"This paper responds to two observations about current government service delivery. First, despite reasonable efforts to improve the design of forms and to establish single points of contact in one-stop shops, citizens still perceive forms as cumbersome. Second, citizens expect governments to act proactively by initiating appropriate government services themselves, instead of relying on requests for services from citizens. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a transition from a one-stop shop to a no-stop shop, where the citizen does not have to perform any action or fill in any forms to receive government services. The contribution of this paper is an e-government stage model that extends existing models. Stage models are suitable tools with which to inspire future developments, and ours extends previous models that guide progress toward the one-stop shop by describing two further stages: the limited no-stop shop and the no-stop shop. We define three dimensions along which to progress: integration of data collection, integration of data storage, and purpose of data use. We provide a first test of the model's validity through three case studies: the e-government practices in Austria, Estonia, and an Australian state government. Our work complements existing research on e-government stage models and proactive government service delivery.","['E-government', 'Forms', 'No-stop shop', 'One-stop shop', 'Proactive government', 'Public administration', 'Stage model']",,en

First, citizens and businesses want to receive e-government services easily but the identification of government entities that are responsible for service delivery in federal states is difficult. Second, e-government has to react to fast developments but decision-making is distributed and rather slow in federal states. To address the area of tension between federalism and e-government, we suggest seven polices that raise internal efficiency and external simplicity of federalism in Germany. We transfer existing policies of e-government literature and practice to our research problem in the course of discussions in a research group of five people. The policies are evaluated in semi-structured interviews with eleven leaders from the German government. The evaluation reveals the appropriateness of the policies to address the issues of federalism in e-government.",,,en

","Behavior-driven development (BDD) brings requirement specifications and their test cases closer together by using a ubiquitous language to describe requirements that are automatically mapped to test methods. Although industry-proven tools support this automated requirement mapping, the test methods need to be implemented manually. The approach presented in this paper transforms BDD-like requirement specifications and low fidelity graphical user interface (GUI) descriptions in the format of wireframes into automatically executable graphical user interface test cases. The requirement descriptions are defined in a domain-specific language (DSL) that obeys the rules of the ubiquitous language enhanced by references to screens and widgets in a graphical user interface model. The paper reports on a controlled AB/BA crossover experiment comparing the efficiency of our approach to the industry-proven JBehave tooling. The results show that the introduced approach on average takes 63% less time to specify automated tests and thereby diminishes the problem of graphical user interface test cases being expensive to write.

61101833,Customer Segmentation Based on Transactional Data Using Stream Clustering,"Customer Segmentation aims to identify groups of customers that share similar interest or behaviour. It is an essential tool in marketing and can be used to target customer segments with tailored marketing strategies. Customer segmentation is often based on clustering techniques. This analysis is typically performed as a snapshot analysis where segments are identified at a specific point in time. However, this ignores the fact that customer segments are highly volatile and segments change over time. Once segments change, the entire analysis needs to be repeated and strategies adapted. In this paper we explore stream clustering as a tool to alleviate this problem. We propose a new stream clustering algorithm which allows to identify and track customer segments over time. The biggest challenge is that customer segmentation often relies on the transaction history of a customer. Since this data changes over time, it is necessary to update customers which have already been incorporated into the clustering. We show how to perform this step incrementally, without the need for periodic re-computations. As a result, customer segmentation can be performed continuously, faster and is more scalable. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using a large real-life case study.",Customer Segmentation; Market Segmentation; Stream Clustering; Data Streams; Machine Learning,"['intentional forgetting', ' future work systems', ' technology acceptance']",en

In this context, onboarding of new hires or allocated team members means the adoption of group characteristics and behaviours. Studies identified cohesion and trust as part of the socialisation process and found communication behaviours that facilitate socialisation. ESN not only enable efficient communication or relationship building, they also make the socialisation processes visible and analysable. In this paper, we propose to use metrics from social network analysis (e.g. extraversion, openness and proactiveness) to operationalise communication behaviours identified as positive for socialisation. First evaluations with two ESN data sets in OLS, beta regression and multilevel models sparsely support the influence on closeness, which we expect to reflect the level of group integration.",Socialisation; Enterprise social networks; User behaviours,"['Evaluation', ' Online Experiments', ' Versioning', ' Intentional Forgetting']",en
61153852,Retrieval of Individual Solutions from Encapsulated Search with a Potentially Infinite Search Space,"Constraint-logic object-oriented programming facilitates the development of applications that occasionally solve search problems. To that end it is possible to define constraints imperatively on-the-fly, using conditions over free variables. As a result, the search space is defined dynamically at runtime, based on the evaluation of such conditions in control structures. Consequently, the search space can - intentionally or by accident - become infinitely large if recursion and/or loops are involved. It is therefore desirable that the corresponding encapsulated search can be controlled by application developers. To that end, we discuss mechanisms for encapsulating such a search space and retrieving solutions from it. Our implementation for Muli is based on an appropriately extended symbolic Java virtual machine and it leverages the Java Stream API to provide a control mechanism that integrates well with object-oriented programs. Moreover, we show how our language Muli behaves for some example programs.","['Constraint-logic object-oriented programming', 'Dynamic solution retrieval', 'Infinite search space', 'Multi-paradigm languages', 'Virtual machine implementation']",,en

61196408,Accurate WiFi based indoor positioning with continuous location sampling,"The ubiquity of WiFi access points and the sharp increase in WiFi-enabled devices carried by humans have paved the way for WiFi- based indoor positioning and location analysis. Locating people in indoor environments has numerous applications in robotics, crowd control, indoor facility optimization, and automated environment mapping. However, existing WiFi-based positioning systems suffer from two major problems: (1) their accuracy and precision is limited due to inherent noise induced by indoor obstacles, and (2) they only occasionally provide location esti- mates, namely when a WiFi-equipped device emits a signal. To mitigate these two issues, we propose a novel Gaussian process (GP) model for WiFi signal strength measurements. It allows for simultaneous smoothing (increasing accuracy and precision of estimators) and interpolation (en- abling continuous sampling of location estimates). Furthermore, simple and efficient smoothing methods for location estimates are introduced to improve localization performance in real-time settings. Experiments are conducted on two data sets from a large real-world commercial indoor retail environment. Results demonstrate that our approach provides sig- nificant improvements in terms of precision and accuracy with respect to unfiltered data. Ultimately, the GP model realizes continuous location sampling with consistently high quality location estimates.",indoor positioning; Gaussian processes; crowd flow analysis; machine learning; WiFi,,en

61199912,Different But Still The Same? How Public And Private Sector Organisations Deal with New Digital Competences,"One of the greatest challenges that digitalisation brings along for the public sector is the need to equip their employees with digital competences. Since private sector companies are often assumed more progressive in exploiting digital media, it seems worthwhile for the public sector to understand how the need for digital competences is addressed by the private sector. However, the public sector needs to be careful before transferring solutions from the private sector one‑on‑one as both sectors exhibit various differences. Our aim in this study is therefore, to analyse which digital competences are needed by employees in both sectors and how the employees are equipped with these competences. In doing so, we have conducted 17 interviews in German public and private sector organisations. Our results exhibit only marginal differences between public and private sector organisations. Furthermore, we find that rather than being able to handle IT, the most important competences in the digital era are soft skills such as time and self‑management as well as to understand the impact of digitalisation in general. In the private sector, analytical skills are furthermore important for developing new business opportunities.

61205711,Primary prevention for employees in the information age organization,"The nature of work and the way it is organized continues to change profoundly. The continuing debate on flexible work arrangements reveals the perceived need of policy makers to react to these changes in a balanced manner. Despite the demand of organizations and employees alike, the negative implications of flexible work arrangements threaten to counteract the equally valid arguments for their benefits. The new autonomy of the individual employee is mirrored by a management style that emphasizes results rather than specifying the way to achieve them. Despite the cherished liberties of the new workplace, studies indicate that stress due to unhealthy work practices has become a major concern for preventive care in these environments. Based on a study with IT professionals we set out to dispute the effectiveness of mainstream measures of preventive care that aim at (re-)regulating work. Instead, we propose an employee-centred approach to preventive care that aims at sensitizing employees to structural defects of new ways of working (through biofeedback and reflection on work patterns) and helping employees in crafting their work practices. Initial results of our empirical study, which combines biometric as well as qualitative data, indicate both the need and the potential for employee-centred preventive care. We demonstrate how bio feedback can inform the coaching of individuals in their quest for sustainable work practices.","['Employee-centred', 'Nature of work', 'Primary prevention', 'Stress', 'Wearables']",,en

61221276,Automated Algorithm Selection: Survey and Perspectives,"It has long been observed that for practically any computational problem that has been intensely studied, different instances are best solved using different algorithms. This is particularly pronounced for computationally hard problems, where in most cases, no single algorithm defines the state of the art; instead, there is a set of algorithms with complementary strengths. This performance complementarity can be exploited in various ways, one of which is based on the idea of selecting, from a set of given algorithms, for each problem instance to be solved the one expected to perform best. The task of automatically selecting an algorithm from a given set is known as the per-instance algorithm selection problem and has been intensely studied over the past 15 years, leading to major improvements in the state of the art in solving a growing number of discrete combinatorial problems, including propositional satisfiability and AI planning. Per-instance algorithm selection also shows much promise for boosting performance in solving continuous and mixed discrete/continuous optimisation problems. This survey provides an overview of research in automated algorithm selection, ranging from early and seminal works to recent and promising application areas. Different from earlier work, it covers applications to discrete and continuous problems, and discusses algorithm selection in context with conceptually related approaches, such as algorithm configuration, scheduling, or portfolio selection. Since informative and cheaply computable problem instance features provide the basis for effective per-instance algorithm selection systems, we also provide an overview of such features for discrete and continuous problems. Finally, we provide perspectives on future work in the area and discuss a number of open research challenges.","['Automated algorithm configuration', 'Automated algorithm selection', 'Combinatorial optimisation', 'Continuous optimisation', 'Data streams', 'Exploratory landscape analysis', 'Feature-based approaches', 'Machine learning', 'Metalearning']",,en

61243834,Research Directions on Decision Support in Disaster Relief Logistics,"Disaster situations lead to a high number of critical and complex decisions regarding disaster relief logistics, which need to be made under dynamic and often unknown circumstances. As this puts decision-makers under high pressure, there is a great need for high-quality decision support. Due to the specific characteristics of disaster relief logistics, standard decision support systems are not capable of depicting the needed complexity. Therefore, research has started to develop approaches specifically tailored to these situations. This paper uses a structured literature review to provide an overview on the so far gained knowledge and to reveal implications for future research. The results show that most of the work in this field focuses on individual, isolated problems and applies optimization techniques to solve them. Nonetheless, the question on whether this is the most suitable way to support decision-makers has been raised. It is therefore proposed to put a focus on integrated decision problems as well as on simulation as an alternative to optimization techniques in research regarding decision support in disaster relief logistics.","['crisis management', 'decision support', 'disaster relief logistics', 'literature review', 'simulation']",,en

61251434,Optimizing Data Stream Representation: An Extensive Survey on Stream Clustering Algorithms,"Analyzing data streams has received considerable attention over the past decades due to the widespread usage of sensors, social media and other streaming data sources. A core research area in this field is stream clustering which aims to recognize patterns in an unordered, infinite and evolving stream of observations. Clustering can be a crucial support in decision making, since it aims for an optimized aggregated representation of a continuous data stream over time and allows to identify patterns in large and high-dimensional data. A multitude of algorithms and approaches has been developed that are able to find and maintain clusters over time in the challenging streaming scenario. This survey explores, summarizes and categorizes a total of 51 stream clustering algorithms and identifies core research threads over the past decades. In particular, it identifies categories of algorithms based on distance thresholds, density grids and statistical models as well as algorithms for high dimensional data. Furthermore, it discusses applications scenarios, available software and how to configure stream clustering algorithms. This survey is considerably more extensive than comparable studies, more up-to-date and highlights how concepts are interrelated and have been developed over time.",Stream Clustering; Data streams; Online Clustering; Pattern Recognition; Decision Support; Data Representation,,en

While looking for career information and guidance, young women consult family and friends but also the internet. Although there is already a plethora of career information websites, those are seldom tailored to the interests of young women. To address the IT-gender gap with the design of a platform that appeals to the needs of the target group, we firstly analyzed existing German websites for career information and guidance. The analysis was framed by literature on women’s IT career choice barriers. Secondly, we evaluated selected websites with focus groups of female students.

61263333,Data-driven Customer Journey Mapping in Local High Streets: A Domain-specific Modeling Language,"In high street retail, abundant research has focused on conceptualizing, empirically investigating, and improving customer experience at touchpoints throughout the customer journey. However, IT-including, smartphones, near-field communication, and broadband access to the Internet-permeates local high streets increasingly and is profoundly transforming the way in which customer experience is co-created throughout a high street customer journey. Current customer experience notations are unable to express customer journeys based on data retrieved from a digitized physical servicescape. The purpose of this paper is to design a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) that enables analyzing and designing customer journeys in a digitized high street retail setting. From a design-oriented standpoint, the developed High Street Journey Modeling Language (HSJML) can be used to design and implement online-offline customer journeys in digitized high streets. From an empirical perspective, the HSJML provides the constructs required for mapping, analyzing, and predicting online-offline customer journeys in local high streets, based on analyzing event-logs from retail platforms.","['Business Process Management', 'Conceptual Modeling', 'Customer Experience', 'Customer Journey Mapping', 'Domain-specific Modeling Language']",,en

To prevent the looming decline of high streets, retailers need to catch up and start to engage the new digital customer. This article illuminates the interplay of diverse, digital interfaces, resources and actors in the co-creation of value in high street retail. Alliances and a digital platform ecosystem are presented as forms of cooperation, where retailers join forces to provide digital touchpoints and boundary-spanning service to the customer, and also actively use customer-generated data to improve their service and strengthen the overall attractiveness of their high streets. We tell a tale of two cities—Burnsley and Beckinsdale—set in the not so distant future, where retailers have taken very different approaches to respond to the digital age.","['High Street', 'Touchpoints', 'High-level Road', 'Store Associate', 'Omnichannel']","['Internet of things business models, Smart energy, Smart energy business models, Smart grid, Smart grid business models']",en
61264569,"Forgetting in future work systems: System characteristics and user-related psychological consequences on emotion, cognition, and behaviors","<p>Work environments of the future offer numerous applications of intentional forgetting (IF) with many benefits for organizations, teams, and individuals. In order to manage increasing amounts of information, IF can be applied as a method to improve performance of work systems or to extend cognitive capacities of humans and/or technical systems. Different technology aided approaches have been suggested for assisting IF, such as: (1) suppressing of irrelevant or distressful information (e.g., by hiding or deleting information), (2) delegating or rearranging information, roles, or tasks to a digital system, or (3) by systematic placement of retrieval cues or triggers to generate or replace behavior. The implementation of IF can thus differ substantially between work areas or systems.</p>
<p>From the perspective of industrial and organizational psychology, it can be argued that IF systems should be designed based on the needs of the human user. Depending on their unique properties, technological systems have been shown to have an impact on human behavior, affective reactions towards a system, and the users' willingness to use the technology (Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008). The aim of the present research program is to classify and compare characteristics of different IF systems. Additionally, psychological effects on users' behavior, experience, and affective reactions will be studied.</p>
<p>For that purpose, the IF systems of six psychological research groups within the research network of the DFG SPP 1921, representing these three approaches, are compared: IF systems focussing on (1) suppressing irrelevant information (Managed forgetting, Frings et al.; Dare2Del, Niessen et al.), (2) delegating/rearranging information or tasks (AdaptPRO, Ellwart et a.; Getrost Vergessen, Hertel et al.), and (3) placement of retrieval cues or triggers (Intentional Forgetting, Routines &amp; Retrieval Cues, Kluge et al.; iVAA, Sonnentag et al.). On a conceptual level, we first examine the characteristics in which the IF systems differ (research question 1). In future experimental studies a research design is applied across the six research projects, to study and compare the systems' effects on psychological experiences and behavior (research question 2). The conceptual approach as well as the planned experiment will be part of this presentation.</p>
<p><em>Theoretical framework:</em> IF systems are compared and connected to theoretical models of technology acceptance (TAM; Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008). Key characteristics are (1) application level of the system (e.g., team vs. individual), (2) level of user control over the system, as well as (3) the system functioning as a facilitator of forgetting (systematic placement of cues) or as an inhibitor of certain behaviors (e.g., by hiding or deleting information). Based on the TAM it is assumed that these characteristics affect individuals' acceptance of the IF system as well as their willingness to work with it.</p>
<p><em>Procedure &amp; Design:</em> Each research group is conducting experimental applications of IF systems differing in the described characteristics. Following the initial experiment (lasting 60-120 mins), participants receive a vignette describing the situation of being in a future work environment using the IF system participants have worked with in the initial experiment. Participants are asked to rate their behavioral and affective reactions, their trust in the system, as well as their willingness to use the system. Comparing behavioral and affective reactions across different IF settings allows us to evaluate system characteristics leading to different user reactions.</p>
<p><em>Value:</em> With growing amounts of information processing requirements at work, IF systems become increasingly important. However, the systems can differ substantially in their characteristics. In order to gain a better understanding of how IF systems impact human behavior and reactions, it is necessary to (1) differentiate between IF system characteristics and (2) gain an understanding of how these characteristics have an impact on users.</p>",intentional forgetting; future work systems; technology acceptance,"['Tactical planning', ' Supply chain', ' Triple bottom line']",en

61264840,Building a Web-Based Information System to Evaluate IT-Artefacts in Online Experiments - The Case of Intentional Forgetting,"<p>Online experiments are a common research method across a variety of academic disciplines. For example, online questionnaires are used in social sciences to collect empirical data from a large number of participants. In business information systems, questionnaires are, for instance, used to evaluate an IT artefact as part of a design science research cycle. Consequently, there are numerous application systems available, some also for free and/or as open source products, which enable researchers to create, design and conduct online questionnaires. Some tools may even support the statistical analysis of participants' replies.</p>
<p>However, traditional questionnaires are based on a question-answer principle. A question or other mostly static content is shown to the user on their screen and the answer must be provided as text inputs, options to be chosen or similar methods known from web forms. While this is sufficient for many use cases, it may become problematic when evaluating an IT artefact, more precisely, a prototype of a software. In Information Systems, a prototypical software may be the outcome of a design science-oriented research approach, which requires evaluation from both a user and a technical perspective. While a questionnaire for sure provides insights on the perceived functionality of a user, technical aspects of the software are hard to gasp. This problem increases, if the actual functionality starts to differ from the perceived functionality users experience. For example, users may think that they solved a task adequately, while in reality they did not as they failed to recognize all technical functionalities provided by the software.</p>
<p>We have developed a web-based information system which integrates both a web-based prototype with a questionnaire system. This allows us to present the prototype on screen to the user, while simultaneously instructing the user to solve a task and collect responses with traditional questionnaire form elements. To make our information system applicable to different use cases, the used prototype can be configured. Therefore, different prototypes can be evaluated in one integrated platform, as long as they are (1) web-based and (2) implement certain interfaces provided by our platform. We demonstrate our information system with the case of intentional forgetting, where we continuously develop new versions of a prototype and where each version is evaluated in the same platform.</p>",Evaluation; Online Experiments; Versioning; Intentional Forgetting,,en

61268849,Generation of High-Performance Code Based on a Domain-Specific Language for Algorithmic Skeletons,"Parallel programming can be difficult and error prone, in particular if low-level optimizations are required in order to reach high performance in complex environments such as multi-core clusters using MPI and OpenMP. One approach to overcome these issues is based on algorithmic skeletons. These are predefined patterns which are implemented in parallel and can be composed by application programmers without taking care of low-level programming aspects. Support for algorithmic skeletons is typically provided as a library. However, optimizations are hard to implement in this setting and programming might still be tedious because of required boiler plate code. Thus, we propose a domain-specific language for algorithmic skeletons that performs optimizations and generates low-level C++ code. Our experimental results on four benchmarks show that the models are significantly shorter and that the execution time and speedup of the generated code often outperform equivalent library implementations using the Muenster Skeleton Library.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'Domain-specific language', 'High-performance computing', 'Model-driven development', 'Parallel programming']",,en

Second, despite a considerable body of research, there is the lack of coherent explanation for this imbalance. Third, although many intervention programmes have been implemented in this area, gender diversity in practice has not improved significantly. This research field also requires theorisation based on the cumulative research efforts in the field, comparative studies in various contexts, and longitudinal studies.

We examine the case of the Metropolitan Healthcare Center, where three previously independent centers were merged into one, and follow the individuals who were appointed to ensure the integration of a new, mutual information system across the three center sites. We draw on a practice perspective and the notion of symbolic capital to shed light on post-merger practices and their outcomes. Our analysis suggests that one of the change agent's practices of boundary consolidation through influence tactics were legitimized through discourses of authoritative knowledge and 'group-making'. This facilitated the construction of symbolic boundaries between the merging parties, thus contributing to the resilience of pre-merger practices despite the planned intention to create change.",,,en

A Qualitative Interview Study on Citizens' Non-Adoption of E-Government,"Despite the growing availability of e-government services, citizens are still reluctant to use them. Prior research has mostly focused on investigating reasons for e-government use. Why individuals refrain from using these services seems to be of less scientific interest. The present study sets out to reveal what barriers to e-government adoption citizens perceive. A qualitative and explorative interview study was conducted with 18 citizens in Germany to better understand how citizens perceive e-government and what keeps them from using it. The study yields twelve different barriers to e-government adoption among which no need to use/rare usage of public services, no personal counsellor, and perceptions of convenience are the most important. The results suggest that the characteristics of the services themselves are highly influential for the decision to not use e-government.

73732994,Attentional Feature Fusion,"Feature fusion, the combination of features from different layers or branches, is an omnipresent part of modern network architectures. It is often implemented via simple operations, such as summation or concatenation, but this might not be the best choice. In this work, we propose a uniform and general scheme, namely attentional feature fusion, which is applicable for most common scenarios, including feature fusion induced by short and long skip connections as well as within Inception layers. To better fuse features of inconsistent semantics and scales, we propose a multiscale channel attention module, which addresses issues that arise when fusing features given at different scales. We also demonstrate that the initial integration of feature maps can become a bottleneck and that this issue can be alleviated by adding another level of attention, which we refer to as iterative attentional feature fusion. With fewer layers or parameters, our models outperform state-of-the-art networks on both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, which suggests that more sophisticated attention mechanisms for feature fusion hold great potential to consistently yield better results compared to their direct counterparts.

73748800,A Configuration Approach to Multi-Sided Platforms in Healthcare: An ALS Platform Case,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurological disease; as a result, patient care requires a complex network of specialists and equipment providers. Despite best intentions, the organizational and regulatory structures in Germany have not been geared towards efficient and effective coordination of care for patients and their caregivers. This situation calls for innovation of care procurement and provision. APST is a multi-sided, patient-centric platform, addressing the coordination of ALS care by combining case management and platform-based service/equipment exchanges. Over time two feedback cycles, quality of platform service and of care, as well as two research cycles, evidencebased care and medical research, have been established and the platform has become an infrastructure for ALS care, exemplifying social entrepreneurship for digital innovation in patient care. We use an interorganizational configuration lens (Lyytinen and Damsgaard 2011) to reconstruct how the organizing logic shaped four components of APST (case management, transaction, information, and research platform).","['ALS', 'Care innovation', 'Configuration analysis', 'Interprofessional collaboration', 'Multi-sided platform', 'Social entrepreneurship']","['Context-sensitivity, Dynamic Bayesian network, Predictive process monitoring, Process mining, Process prediction']",en

These technologies began as instrumental aids to support office work of individuals but have since also become the basis for social interactions and community building in organisations and more recently have become able to perform managerial roles based on advanced AI capabilities. Our call for papers to this special issue invited original studies to go further and advance our thinking on the strategic implications of this layered evolution of workplace technologies on work and the structure of organisations. In this introduction, we synthesise the main themes from the special issue, and also ongoing dialogues with the growing community at the regular AIS / IFIP 9.1 workshop on the Changing Nature of Work. A key observation is that the work involved in configuring emergent Digital/Human configurations, is vastly under-reported and poorly understood. Paradoxically, this configuring work is more demanding and critical in the shaping of organisations that we see moving forward. We suggest that this type of largely invisible work requires engagement beyond the level of execution or even the meaning of work, it requires intervening with third order effects that get to the core of what an organisation is. We highlight the challenges for organisations in dealing with third order change, particularly because these effects are beyond existing frames of reference and require a more dynamic and supple response based on the values, purpose and~intent dominant~in the organisation – we describe this as structural digital work. Leaders that are unable or unwilling to engage with effects at this level, and this type of work, will miss identifying core opportunities and risks associated with the digital transformation emerging in organisations. We also reflect on the value of current theories and methods used to research this emergent phenomenon.",Digital work; Organisational transformation; Digital/Human configurations; Digital transformation; Changing nature of work; New ways of working,"['Constraint-logic object-oriented programming, Free arrays, Non-deterministic element access, Reference types']",en
73752223,Evolutionary Diversity Optimization and the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem,"In the area of evolutionary computation the calculation of diverse sets of high-quality solutions to a given optimization problem has gained momentum in recent years under the term evolutionary diversity optimization. Theoretical insights into the working principles of baseline evolutionary algorithms for diversity optimization are still rare. In this paper we study the well-known Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST) in the context of diversity optimization where population diversity is measured by the sum of pairwise edge overlaps. Theoretical results provide insights into the fitness landscape of the MST diversity optimization problem pointing out that even for a population of μ = 2 fitness plateaus (of constant length) can be reached, but nevertheless diverse sets can be calculated in polynomial time. We supplement our theoretical results with a series of experiments for the unconstrained and constraint case where all solutions need to fulfill a minimal quality threshold. Our results show that a simple (μ + 1)-EA can effectively compute a diversified population of spanning trees of high quality.","['Evolutionary algorithms', 'Evolutionary diversity optimization', 'Minimum spanning tree', 'Runtime analysis']",,en

73758509,Approximate Nearest-Neighbour Fields via Massively-Parallel Propagation-Assisted K-D Trees,"Nearest neighbour fields accurately and intuitively describe the transformation between two images and have been heavily used in computer vision. Generating such fields, however, is not an easy task due to the induced computational complexity, which quickly grows with the sizes of the images. Modern parallel devices such as graphics processing units depict a viable way of reducing the practical run time of such compute-intensive tasks. In this work, we propose a novel parallel implementation for one of the state-of-the-art methods for the computation of nearest neighbour fields, called p ropagation-assisted k -d trees. The resulting implementation yields valuable computational savings over a corresponding multi-core implementation. Additionally, it is tuned to consume only little additional memory and is, hence, capable of dealing with high-resolution image data, which is vital as image quality standards keep rising.","['computer vision', 'high-performance computing', 'nearest neighbour fields', 'propagation-assisted k-d trees']","['E-government strategy', ' digital government strategy', ' digital government', ' e-government', ' policy analysis']",en

73766606,Attention as Activation,"Activation functions and attention mechanisms are typically treated as having different purposes and have evolved differently. However, both concepts can be formulated as a nonlinear gating function. Inspired by their similarity, we propose a novel type of activation units called attentional activation (ATAC) units as a unification of activation functions and attention mechanisms. In particular, we propose a local channel attention module for the simultaneous non-linear activation and element-wise feature refinement, which locally aggregates point-wise cross-channel feature contexts. By replacing the well-known rectified linear units by such ATAC units in convolutional networks, we can construct fully attentional networks that perform significantly better with a modest number of additional parameters. We conducted detailed ablation studies on the ATAC units using several host networks with varying network depths to empirically verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the units. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the ATAC units against existing activation functions as well as other attention mechanisms on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. Our experimental results show that networks constructed with the proposed ATAC units generally yield performance gains over their competitors given a comparable number of parameters.",,,en

For this purpose, several approaches to automate the algorithm design have been investigated over the last years. Among them, Genetic Programming-based Hyper-Heuristics (GPHH) are able to design algorithms of varying lengths and permutations of algorithm's operators. Although the parametrization of generated algorithms is crucial for further adaptation of its behavior to the underlying problems, it has been neglected or only considered to a limited extent in many applications of GPHHs. This work proposes a way to integrate GPHH with parameter configuration. In particular, a Cartesian Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic (CGPHH) is developed. The proposed method is applied to the multi-level capacitated production lot-sizing problem, a complex and relevant problem in production planning. Conducted experiments evaluate both its efficacy and the quality of the generated algorithms. Finally, results are compared to the CGPHH without parameter configuration and a human-designed algorithm, indicating the ability of CGPHH-PC to generate algorithms that have the best overall-performance for different cutoff times.",Heuristic algorithms; Genetic programming; Sociology; Statistics; Task analysis; Classification algorithms; Hyper-heuristics; Genetic Programming; Algorithm Generation; Parameter Configuration; Lot-sizing Problem,,en

This<br />paper aims to develop a first analysis of the potential relationship between S&OP<br />and sustainability and develops a comprehension of the possibility of managing<br />sustainability through the lens of S&OP. The researchers conducted a systematic<br />literature review to integrate the different and fragmented contents available in the<br />literature associated with S&OP, especially to its tactical planning perspective, and<br />sustainability. The absence of in-depth discussions on the feasibility of using tactical<br />planning as a driver to improve sustainability can be understood as evidence that,<br />in general, the academic literature already accepts this idea. The current discussion<br />seems to be in the “How to do” level, which confirms the great opportunity to adapt<br />S&OP to better achieve goals related to sustainability.

73784901,On the Usefulness of User Nudging and Strength Indication concerning Unlock Pattern Security,"Strong passwords rely on complexity and length, no matter if text-based or of any other type. For text-based passwords, there are many established methods to measure complexity while for graphical passwords, e.g., unlock patterns on mobile devices, it is still an open question what criteria can be used to describe complexity. Also, users tend to choose a stronger password if the strength of their password is visualized. We conduct a user study on the helpfulness of strength indication and user nudging regarding unlock patterns. Participants create such graphical passwords under carefully specified circumstances, e.g., practical nudges on how to improve their password's security. We show that the choice of a strong password does not rely on being tech-savvy and users with different technical backgrounds can be helped by visualizations of a graphical password strength as well as by hints on how to improve it. Most users even perceive this as a helpful feature.",,"['Trust', ' Human Computer Interaction', ' Information Technology Artefacts', ' Theory', ' Framework']",en
73784989,Opportunistic Tracking in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber-Physical Systems raise a new dimension of security concerns as they open up the opportunity for attackers to affect a real-world environment. These systems are often applied in specific environments with special requirements and a common issue is to keep track of movements in a mobile system, e.g., involving autonomous robots, drones or sensory I/O devices. In Opportunistic Networks, nodes are usually mobile, forwarding messages from one device to another, not relying on external infrastructure like WiFi. Due to compact and convenient wearability, the nodes of an OppNet might be used to detect the absence and presence of devices or even people in an area where classical networks may not be reliable enough. In this paper, we combine opportunistic network technology with cyber-physical systems and propose a reliable routing algorithm for nodes tracking. Our real-world setup implements hardware sensor tags to evaluate the algorithm in a state-of-the-art environment. Efficiency and performance are compared with established algorithms i. e., Epidemic and Prophet, in terms of latency, network overhead, as well as message delivery probability, and to evaluate the algorithm's scalability, we simulate the tracking in a huge environment.",,"['IT/IS-Strategie', ' Strategische IT/IS-Planung', ' IT/IS-Strategizing', ' Strategiekonzepte', ' Strategieinhalte', ' Strategiemodelle', ' Strategiekalküle']",en

Design / Methodology / Approach: This study conducts a systematic literature review to synthesize the state of the art of IT and BA in S&OP. The review follows the rigorous approach by Thomé et al. (2016). Through the literature search, 442 results were retrieved, of which 57 were selected for the analysis. The results containing analytics techniques are classified by the planning tasks of S&OP that they address. Results: The analysis provides an overview of the dominant themes in the field of IT, BA and S&OP and leads to a classification of the existing research in the field of BA for S&OP. This study finds that IT can be an enabler of S&OP and that most analytics techniques address S&OP through fully-integrated optimization approaches. Yet, the impact on the S&OP process has not been explored. This study thus identifies gaps for future research and proposes a research agenda on BA on S&OP. Limitations of the investigation: The systematic literature review is restricted to the Elvesier SCOPUS database. SCOPUS has excellent coverage regarding relevant journals for this study. Despite SCOPUS being a prominent scientific database, other databases might reveal additional studies and further insights. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide insights on how IT and BA can support and influence the S&OP process. Originality / Value: In recent years, S&OP, IT and BA have seen a growing interest by scholars. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the number of published literature reviews on S&OP and BA is scarce.

73802818,Implementation of BFASTmonitor Algorithm on Google Earth Engine to Support Large-Area and Sub-Annual Change Monitoring Using Earth Observation Data,"Monitoring of abnormal changes on the earth's surface (e.g., forest disturbance) has improved greatly in recent years because of satellite remote sensing. However, high computational costs inherently associated with processing and analysis of satellite data often inhibit large-area and sub-annual monitoring. Normal seasonal variations also complicate the detection of abnormal changes at sub-annual scale in the time series of satellite data. Recently, however, computationally powerful platforms, such as the Google Earth Engine (GEE), have been launched to support large-area analysis of satellite data. Change detection methods with the capability to detect abnormal changes in time series data while accounting for normal seasonal variations have also been developed but are computationally intensive. Here, we report an implementation of BFASTmonitor (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend monitor) on GEE to support large-area and sub-annual change monitoring using satellite data available in GEE. BFASTmonitor is a data-driven unsupervised change monitoring approach that detects abnormal changes in time series data, with near real-time monitoring capabilities. Although BFASTmonitor has been widely used in forest cover loss monitoring, it is a generic change monitoring approach that can be used to monitor changes in a various time series data. Using Landsat time series for normalised difference moisture index (NDMI), we evaluated the performance of our GEE BFASTmonitor implementation (GEE BFASTmonitor) by detecting forest disturbance at three forest areas (humid tropical forest, dry tropical forest, and miombo woodland) while comparing it to the original R-based BFASTmonitor implementation (original BFASTmonitor). A map-to-map comparison showed that the spatial and temporal agreements on forest disturbance between the original and our GEE BFASTmonitor implementations were high. At each site, the spatial agreement was more than 97%, whereas the temporal agreement was over 94%. The high spatial and temporal agreement show that we have properly translated and implemented the BFASTmonitor algorithm on GEE. Naturally, due to different numerical solvers being used for regression model fitting in R and GEE, small differences could be observed in the outputs. These differences were most noticeable at the dry tropical forest and miombo woodland sites, where the forest exhibits strong seasonality. To make GEE BFASTmonitor accessible to non-technical users, we developed a web application with simplified user interface. We also created a JavaScript-based GEE BFASTmonitor package that can be imported as a module. Overall, our GEE BFASTmonitor implementation fills an important gap in large-area environmental change monitoring using earth observation data.","['BFASTmonitor', 'Forest disturbance', 'Google Earth Engine', 'Landsat', 'Sub-annual']","['Tight-coupled S&OP', ' Agility', ' Procedural quality']",en

73813897,Applied matching algorithms - Selected problems from the domains of computer science education and market design,"Matching algorithms are a topic of research in various domains, from the applications in computer science education to the areas of market design in economics. Matching problems can be characterized by their parameter space, its constraints on the validity of a solution, and the optimization goal. This thesis depicts the similarity and differences between matching problems as well as between the algorithms that are applied to solve them in an interdisciplinary context. It highlights the incentives of different domains to solve similar problems through different techniques and approaches. In this context, two selected matching problems from the domains of computer science education and market design are presented and discussed. The first problem deals with the automatic assessment of UML class diagrams in the setting of formative e-assessment. A new e-assessment tool is proposed, which uses error-tolerant graph matching techniques to analyse a student's submission regarding the implementation of design patterns. Then, feedback is generated based on the design pattern applied by the student and the differences to an exemplary solution. The second problem approaches the allocation of children to childcare facilities in German cities. A case study is outlined that investigates this two-sided market and analyses it in the context of game-theoretic matching theory. The identified requirements are used for the design of the new iterative deferred acceptance with ties mechanism. In the thesis, this mechanism is defined and evaluated for its applicability in different markets. The two projects exemplify how existing matching theory can be applied in practice and how the adaption of ideas from different domains can be helpful to improve the knowledge base of research about matching algorithms in general.",,"['Humanitarian logistics', ' humanitarian supply chain management', ' multi-method simulation', ' SPHERE', ' simulation study']",en

This does not only challenge local strategies that can get stuck. It also hinders meta-heuristics like evolutionary algorithms in convergence to the global optimum. In this paper we present a new concept of gradient descent, which is able to escape local traps. It relies on multiobjectivization of the original problem and applies the recently proposed and here slightly modified multi-objective local search mechanism MOGSA. We use a sophisticated visualization technique for multi-objective problems to prove the working principle of our idea. As such, this work highlights the transfer of new insights from the multi-objective to the single-objective domain and provides first visual evidence that multiobjectivization can link single-objective local optima in multimodal landscapes.",,"['Cross-platform development, Development approaches, Mobile app, Performance benchmark']",en
73815689,Per-Instance Configuration of the Modularized CMA-ES by Means of Classifier Chains and Exploratory Landscape Analysis,"In this paper, we rely on previous work proposing a modularized version of CMA-ES, which captures several alterations to the conventional CMA-ES developed in recent years. Each alteration provides significant advantages under certain problem properties, e.g., multi-modality, high conditioning. These distinct advancements are implemented as modules which result in 4608 unique versions of CMA-ES. Previous findings illustrate the competitive advantage of enabling and disabling the aforementioned modules for different optimization problems. Yet, this modular CMA-ES is lacking a method to automatically determine when the activation of specific modules is auspicious and when it is not. We propose a well-performing instance-specific algorithm configuration model which selects an (almost) optimal configuration of modules for a given problem instance. In addition, the structure of this configuration model is able to capture inter-dependencies between modules, e.g., two (or more) modules might only be advantageous in unison for some problem types, making the orchestration of modules a crucial task. This is accomplished by chaining multiple random forest classifiers together into a so-called Classifier Chain based on a set of numerical features extracted by means of Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) to describe the given problem instances.","['Algorithm Configuration', 'Classifier Chains', 'Exploratory Landscape Analysis', 'Modularized CMA-ES', 'Single-Objective Continuous Optimization']",,en
73822638,Literature Review on Maturity Models for Digital Supply Chains,"Goal: Today, digital technologies have significant effects on supply chains as companies explore and exploit their opportunities. Digital supply chains promise advantages over traditional ones. A maturity model is a helpful tool to assess the current state of digitalization in supply chains and to guide companies towards implementation. The main goal of this paper is to investigate existing maturity models for digital supply chains and propose possibilities for future research. Design / Methodology / Approach: A structured literature review is conducted to identify relevant maturity models. Those are analyzed regarding their type and emphasis on a specific supply chain function or certain digitalization dimension. Results: Twenty-eight maturity models are identified. Each of them focuses on a particular supply chain function or a specific digital technology. A focus on manufacturing (Industry 4.0) and, consequently, a lack of research regarding other aspects of the supply chain digitalization becomes evident. Moreover, most papers lack coverage of all digitalization dimensions. Besides, more rigorous research regarding the quality of the maturity models, their evaluation, and application is needed. Limitations of the investigation: The conducted review is limited to two databases (Scopus and Web of Science). Two researchers conducted the analysis, which might lead to some bias. Furthermore, the analysis could be broadened and performed more in-depth to derive further insights. Practical implications: Practitioners might use the presented overview of existing maturity models to identify a well-developed one that fits their desired application scenario.

However, the mere provision of a DSS may not be sufficient to facilitate beneficial work outcomes because employees often do not rely on a DSS. Therefore, we examined whether users' trust in a DSS increases positive effects of DSS provision on several core work outcomes (i.e., performance, well-being, and release of cognitive capacities). Moreover, we examined whether trust effects on these work outcomes depend on specific context conditions (i.e., user accountability, distraction, and market dynamics). We tested our hypotheses in a laboratory experiment with N = 201 participants who received assistance by a DSS in a simulated sales planning scenario. In line with our assumptions, trust in the DSS was positively related to users' performance and well-being. Moreover, the link between trust and strain as well as release of cognitive capacities were qualified by distraction, so that higher distraction diminished these links. No such moderation occurred for user accountability and market dynamics.","['decision making', 'decision support systems', 'distraction', 'DSS', 'trust in technology']","['Single-Objective Optimization', ' Multimodality', ' Multiobjectivization', ' Continuous Optimization', ' Local Search']",en

Few approaches for tackling this challenge consider a multi-perspective view, where the flow perspective of the process is combined with its surrounding context. Given the many sources of data in today's world, context can vary widely and have various meanings. This paper addresses the issue of context being cause or effect of the next event and its impact on next event prediction. We leverage previous work on probabilistic models to develop a Dynamic Bayesian Network technique. Probabilistic models are considered comprehensible and they allow the end-user and his or her understanding of the domain to be involved in the prediction. Our technique models context attributes that have either a cause or effect relationship towards the event. We evaluate our technique with two real-life data sets and benchmark it with other techniques from the field of predictive process monitoring. The results show that our solution achieves superior prediction results if context information is correctly introduced into the model.","['Context-sensitivity', 'Dynamic Bayesian network', 'Predictive process monitoring', 'Process mining', 'Process prediction']",,en

73856477,Developing an Analytical Framework for Analyzing and Comparing National E-Government Strategies,"Across the world, e-government strategies are developed for the effective digitalization of the public sector. They offer governments a framework for dealing with challenges such as technical and legal interoperability and collaboration between public and private sector stakeholders, and for promoting a future vision for a digital public sector. Since e-government strategies are policy document and, thus, likely to convey biased perspectives, analyses of these strategies can yield insights into these biases and different perspectives on public sector digitalization. Until now, there has been no widely recognized framework for systematically analyzing e-government strategies. Based on literature and by applying our findings to the Danish and German e-government strategies, we have developed a novel analytical framework for comprehensively analyzing and comparing national e-government strategies. The framework focuses on the strategies’ role, their function, and their specific content, such as strategic goals and measures to implement e-government. Analyzing and comparing both countries as a proof of concept shows fundamental differences in the level of digitalization and the implementation of e-government. This article contributes to both research and practice by presenting a comprehensive framework for analyzing national e-government strategies and by discussing their context-sensitivity.",E-government strategy; digital government strategy; digital government; e-government; policy analysis,,en
73882517,Walking a Mile in Their Shoes—A Citizen Journey to Explore Public Service Delivery from the Citizen Perspective,"Up to now, public administrations have taken a supply-oriented approach to the design of electronic services for citizens resulting in low usage rates. In contrast, companies in the private sector have been relying on demand-oriented service design for many years. They make use of so-called ‘customer journeys’ to better understand the perception of services by customers and to tailor the design of electronic services to that perception. Although also governments and public administrations have been increasingly recognizing the benefits of customer journeys, there is still a lack of research on the application of customer journeys in the public sector. Especially, there is no customer journey that is applicable to a wide range of public services and serves as a general blueprint for public services. Therefore, in this paper, we present a generic citizen journey that depicts the delivery process for transactional public services from a citizen perspective. The citizen journey depicts the points of interaction that citizens have with public services. We evaluated the citizen journey in a focus group with public servants and a survey with citizens. The evaluation reveals the citizen journey’s general usefulness. Researchers benefit from our citizen journey through a better understanding of the service delivery process and the different steps that could impact citizen experience. Practitioners can use the citizen journey in the design of citizen-centric services and during the actual service delivery to guide citizens through the delivery process.","['Citizen journey', 'Customer journey', 'Digital government', 'Service design', 'User journey']","['Business Model Innovation, Business Model Pattern, Smart Home']",en

So far, work in constraint-logic object-oriented programming was limited to considering constraints that only involve logic variables ofprimitive types; in particular, boolean, integer, and floating-point numbers. However, the availabilityof object-oriented features calls for the option to use logic variables in lieu of objects as well. Therefore, support for reference-type logic variables (orfree objects) is required. With the presentwork, we add support for reference-type logic variables to a Java-based constraint-logic object-oriented language. Allowing free objects in statements and expressions results in novel interactionswith objects at runtime, for instance, non-deterministic execution of invocations on free objects(taking arbitrary class hierarchies and overriding into account). In order to achieve this, we alsopropose a dynamic type constraint that restricts the types of free objects at runtime",Constraint-logic object-oriented programming; reference-type logic variables; programming lan-guage implementation; runtime systems,"['business process, monitoring, prediction, procedure model']",en

Now some traditional, less-digitalized brick and mortar (BaM) retailers are starting to counteract the increasing competition by adopting digital touchpoints. However, the academic literature offers little in terms of what determines customers&rsquo; behavioral intentions toward e-service touchpoints. Therefore, drawing from the dominant design theory, this article first conceptually adapts selected dominant touchpoints of leading e-commerce solutions to BaM retail. Then 250 shoppers are surveyed regarding the likeliness that they will use the selected touchpoints, followed by an exploratory factor analysis to determine the touchpoints&rsquo; characteristics that lead to the shoppers&rsquo; assessments. The results suggest that customers prefer touchpoints that support product search and selection, provide information, and increase shopping efficiency. The likeliness that surveyed shoppers will use the touchpoints was affected by the functionality provided, the content conveyed, and the mediating device. The results provide a foundation for further research on customers&rsquo; behavioral intentions toward BaM e-service touchpoints and provide useful information for BaM retailers.",Brick and Mortar; Retail; E-Service; Touchpoint; Acceptance,"['Digital business strategy, Digital infrastructure, Digital strategy, Digital Transformation, IT/IS strategy, Strategic information systems planning']",en

The results of this theoretical approach provide a role framework for IT in trust-related interactions distinguishing the role of IT between a) a simple interaction enabler between two other entities, b) a mechanism for mitigating risk in an interaction between two other entities, c) a tool used in an interaction, and d) a trustee in an interaction. In addition, assumptions on the differences these roles might have on the perception of the users, i.e. reliability, control, and trust, are given for each role.

73945237,"High-Level Parallel Ant Colony Optimization with
Algorithmic Skeletons","Parallel implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms such as the ant colony optimization (ACO) have been widely used to shorten the execution time when solving complex optimization problems. When aiming for a GPU environment, developing efficient parallel versions of such algorithms using CUDA can be a difficult and error-prone task even for experienced programmers. To overcome this issue, the parallel programming model of Algorithmic Skeletons simplifies parallel programs by abstracting from low-level features. This is realized by defining common programming patterns (e.g. map, fold and zip) that later on will be converted to efficient parallel code. In this paper, we show how algorithmic skeletons formulated in the domain specific language Musket can cope with the development of a parallel implementation of ACO and how that compares to a low-level implementation. Our experimental results show that Musket suits the development of ACO. Besides making it easier for the programmer to deal with the parallelization aspects, Musket generates high performance code with similar execution times when compared to low-level implementations.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'Ant colony optimization', 'High performance computing']",,en

73952486,XNAP: Making LSTM-based Next Activity Predictions Explainable by Using LRP,"Predictive business process monitoring (PBPM) is a class of techniques designed to predict behaviour, such as next activities, in running traces. PBPM techniques aim to improve process performance by providing predictions to process analysts, supporting them in their decision making. However, the PBPM techniques’ limited predictive quality was considered as the essential obstacle for establishing such techniques in practice. With the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), the techniques’ predictive quality could be improved for tasks like the next activity prediction. While DNNs achieve a promising predictive quality, they still lack comprehensibility due to their hierarchical approach of learning representations. Nevertheless, process analysts need to comprehend the cause of a prediction to identify intervention mechanisms that might affect the decision making to secure process performance. In this paper, we propose XNAP, the first explainable, DNN-based PBPM technique for the next activity prediction. XNAP integrates a layer-wise relevance propagation method from the field of explainable artificial intelligence to make predictions of a long short-term memory DNN explainable by providing relevance values for activities. We show the benefit of our approach through two real-life event logs.","['Business process management', 'Deep learning', 'Explainable artificial intelligence', 'Layer-wise relevance propagation', 'Predictive business process monitoring', 'Process mining']","['Smart energy business models', ' Smart grid business models', ' Internet of things business models', ' Business model innovation']",en
73953042,An unexpectedly large count of trees in the West African Sahara and Sahel,"A large proportion of dryland trees and shrubs (hereafter referred to collectively as trees) grow in isolation, without canopy closure. These non-forest trees have a crucial role in biodiversity, and provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, food resources and shelter for humans and animals1,2. However, most public interest relating to trees is devoted to forests, and trees outside of forests are not well-documented3. Here we map the crown size of each tree more than 3 m2 in size over a land area that spans 1.3 million km2 in the West African Sahara, Sahel and sub-humid zone, using submetre-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning4. We detected over 1.8 billion individual trees (13.4 trees per hectare), with a median crown size of 12 m2, along a rainfall gradient from 0 to 1,000 mm per year. The canopy cover increases from 0.1% (0.7 trees per hectare) in hyper-arid areas, through 1.6% (9.9 trees per hectare) in arid and 5.6% (30.1 trees per hectare) in semi-arid zones, to 13.3% (47 trees per hectare) in sub-humid areas. Although the overall canopy cover is low, the relatively high density of isolated trees challenges prevailing narratives about dryland desertification5–7, and even the desert shows a surprisingly high tree density.

73958744,Research Directions on Decision Support in Disaster Relief Logistics,"Disaster situations lead to a high number of critical and complex decisions regarding disaster relief logistics, which need to be made under dynamic and often unknown circumstances. As this puts decision-makers under high pressure, there is a great need for high-quality decision support. Due to the specific characteristics of disaster relief logistics, standard decision support systems are not capable of depicting the needed complexity. Therefore, research has started to develop approaches specifically tailored to these situations. This paper uses a structured literature review to provide an overview on the so far gained knowledge and to reveal implications for future research. The results show that most of the work in this field focuses on individual, isolated problems and applies optimization techniques to solve them. Nonetheless, the question on whether this is the most suitable way to support decision-makers has been raised. It is therefore proposed to put a focus on integrated decision problems as well as on simulation as an alternative to optimization techniques in research regarding decision support in disaster relief logistics.",decision support; disaster relief logistics; crisis management; literature review; simulation,"['Digital transformation, Idea management, Software design, Technology roadmap, Web tool']",en

73958936,Bringing Technology and Humanitarian Values Together: A Framework to Design and Assess Humanitarian Information Systems,"Designing information systems (IS) in support of humanitarian work has been a challenge widely pursued for decades. However, one aspect that has been undervalued within systems design is the role of the underpinning humanitarian values and culture as part of system effectiveness. Further, it remains understudied how we might incorporate those values into the information system design process. We address both these aspects by 1) analyzing humanitarian values of effectiveness as they impact information systems design, and 2) incorporating humanitarian values as part of the design criteria. In this paper, we present the idea that the ""maturity"" of an IS design to be effective for the humanitarian context is assessed by how well it incorporates humanitarian values. Therefore, we move away from a product-centered design towards an approach, which features the socio-technical relationship. We present a maturity matrix, which aims to translate and communicate humanitarian effectiveness into the design and development terminology used by technology designers. This matrix is housed within a participatory framework that allows for the development of trust and shared understanding between these two domains. The framework serves as a road-map for designers and humanitarian agencies to adapt the IS design and development process to better accommodate the IS needs of the humanitarian mission, its values, and culture.",humanitarian technology; human-centered design; sociomaterality; ICT4D; IS design; humanitarian values; hidden work; effective design; complex systems design,"['BPMN, control-flow graph analysis, data-flow anomalies, process-driven application']",en
73959123,An empirical investigation of performance overhead in cross-platform mobile development frameworks,"The heterogeneity of the leading mobile platforms in terms of user interfaces, user experience, programming language, and ecosystem have made cross-platform development frameworks popular. These aid the creation of mobile applications &ndash; apps &ndash; that can be executed across the target platforms (typically Android and iOS) with minimal to no platform-specific code. Due to the cost- and time-saving possibilities introduced through adopting such a framework, researchers and practitioners alike have taken an interest in the underlying technologies. Examining the body of knowledge, we, nonetheless, frequently encounter discussions on the drawbacks of these frameworks, especially with regard to the performance of the apps they generate. Motivated by the ongoing discourse and a lack of empirical evidence, we scrutinised the essential piece of the cross-platform frameworks: the bridge enabling cross-platform code to communicate with the underlying operating system and device hardware APIs. The study we present in the article benchmarks and measures the performance of this bridge to reveal its associated overhead in Android apps. The development of the artifacts for this experiment was conducted using five cross-platform development frameworks to generate Android apps, in addition to a baseline native Android app implementation. Our results indicate that &ndash; for Android apps &ndash; the use of cross-platform frameworks for the development of mobile apps may lead to decreased performance compared to the native development approach. Nevertheless, certain cross-platform frameworks can perform equally well or even better than native on certain metrics which highlights the importance of well-defined technical requirements and specifications for deliberate selection of a cross-platform framework or overall development approach.","['Cross-platform development', 'Development approaches', 'Mobile app', 'Performance benchmark']","['Continuous Software Engineering, Feature-driven development, Process-Driven Application']",en
73959314,One-Shot Decision-Making with and without Surrogates,"One-shot decision making is required in situations in which we can evaluate a fixed number of solution candidates but do not have any possibility for further, adaptive sampling. Such settings are frequently encountered in neural network design, hyper-parameter optimization, and many simulation-based real-world optimization tasks, in which evaluations are costly and time sparse. It seems intuitive that well-distributed samples should be more meaningful in one-shot decision making settings than uniform or grid-based samples, since they show a better coverage of the decision space. In practice, quasi-random designs such as Latin Hypercube Samples and low-discrepancy point sets form indeed the state of the art, as confirmed by a number of recent studies and competitions. In this work we take a closer look into the correlation between the distribution of the quasi-random designs and their performance in one-shot decision making tasks, with the goal to investigate whether the assumed correlation between uniform distribution and performance can be confirmed. We study three different decision tasks: classic one-shot optimization (only the best sample matters), one-shot optimization with surrogates (allowing to use surrogate models for selecting a design that need not necessarily be one of the evaluated samples), and one-shot regression (i.e., function approximation, with minimization of mean squared error as objective). Our results confirm an advantage of low-discrepancy designs for all three settings. The overall correlation, however, is rather weak. We complement our study by evolving problem-specific samples that show significantly better performance for the regression task than the standard approaches based on low-discrepancy sequences, giving strong indication that significant performance gains over state-of-the-art one-shot sampling techniques are possible.",,"['Constraint-logic object-oriented programming, Free arrays, Non-deterministic element access, Reference types']",en

Hence, practitioners are looking for elements that make these new business models attractive.

We explore the applicability of business model pattern collections by examining the smart home sector.

In order to provide companies with the opportunity to uncover the areas that are lacking behind in the digitalization process or self-assess their current transformation status, we pursue the goal to develop a digital transformation maturity model fitting to IT companies. The artifact was developed in collaboration with an IT company from the energy sector. This case serves as a first and exemplary application scenario. Based on literature on digital transformation maturity models and eight expert interviews, we iteratively designed and evaluated a maturity model tailored to IT companies. As a result, we synthesized five dimensions: culture, ecosystem, operations, governance, and strategy. Each dimension consists of further criteria specifying the respective dimension. Our artifact shows a high fit with the needs of the company under investigation and can serve as a blueprint for other IT companies.","['Digital Transformation', 'Digital Transformation Maturity Model', 'Digitalization', 'Maturity Model']","['Media collections', ' Media choice', ' Digital traces', ' Distributed work', ' Replication study']",en
73981231,Exploring the Effect of Context Information on Deep Learning Business Process Predictions,"Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) techniques for predicting the next activity in running business processes developed into an established topic of Business Process Management. Recent research suggests using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for PPM because DNNs are good at learning the intricate structure of business processes. Most of these works use Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMs) and consider only the control flow information of an event log. Beyond control flow information, context information can add valuable information to a predictive model. However, the effects of context attributes on the predictive quality have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. This work addresses this gap and provides two insights. First, a context-sensitive prediction capability can improve the predictive quality of an LSTM-based technique. Second, the added value of context information to the quality of predicting the next activity varies in the course of a running process instance.","['context-sensitivity', 'deep learning', 'Predictive process monitoring']","['Algorithmic skeletons, Ant colony optimization, High performance computing']",en

A variety of machine learning (ML) based PPM techniques have been proposed by researchers to tackle several PPM-related prediction tasks, such as next activity, time, risk, or outcome. However, adopting such a PPM technique involves many complex tasks, including the selection and parametrization of a machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the novel domain lacks a set of guidelines on how to implement the methods to enable a broad and non-expert user group to benefit from it. As a remedy, this paper proposes a procedure model, which can serve as a step by step framework during the implementation and application of PPM. We conclude our work by demonstrating the applicability of our procedure model and by outlining our case study-based evaluation concept.","['business process', 'monitoring', 'prediction', 'procedure model']","['Evolutionary algorithms, Evolutionary diversity optimisation, High-order entropy, Traveling salesperson problem']",en
73981410,Structuring Business Process Context Information for Process Monitoring and Prediction,"The advance of Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and with it the integration of various systems - generally referred to as digitalization - provides huge amounts of data that can be leveraged by modern Business Process Management (BPM) methods. Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) represents a novel branch of process mining, which deals with real-time analysis of currently running process instances and also with the prediction of its future behavior. Most of the early PPM techniques base their analyzes and predictions solely on the control-flow characteristic of a business process, i.e. the process events. Recently, researchers are attempting to incorporate additional process-related information, also known as the process context, into their predictive models. To use the available context information to full capacity, we require an understanding of the concept of business process context information. Based on both empirical and conceptual sources, we develop a taxonomy that provides a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of business process context information. This overview can then be leveraged, e.g. in process monitoring and prediction. Our taxonomy adds descriptive knowledge to the field of BPM, specifically PPM, and strengthens the conceptual foundation of context-sensitive process monitoring and prediction.","['Business Process', 'Context', 'Context-Sensitivity', 'Predictive Process Monitoring', 'Taxonomy']","['Evolutionary algorithms, Evolutionary diversity optimisation, Sub-modular functions']",en

73989461,Assessing Citizens' Non-Adoption of Public E-Services in Germany,"The amount of acceptance literature stands in sharp contrast to the persistently low adoption rates of public e-services in most European countries. Despite huge investments on the one hand and a vast body of literature on success factors on the other hand, citizens are surprisingly uninterested in the use of public e-services. However, only few studies explicitly address phenomena of resistance or non-adoption. In order to explain citizens' non-adoption and adoption of public e-services, this article builds on the Inhibitor Theory as an analytical framework, based on which a dual factor-model is proposed and tested with survey data from 495 German citizens. The results of this study indicate that non-adoption of public e-services is less driven by technical issues than suggested in current literature. Instead, the need for personal consultation and status quo bias are the strongest predictors of citizens' non-adoption.",e-government; digital government; public e-services; trust; technology adoption,,en

However, many real-world problems are composed of several interacting components. The Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) addresses such interactions by combining two combinatorial optimisation problems, namely the TSP and the Knapsack Problem (KP). Recently, a new problem called the node weight dependent Traveling Salesperson Problem (W-TSP) has been introduced where nodes have weights that influence the cost of the tour. In this paper, we compare W-TSP and TTP. We investigate the structure of the optimised tours for W-TSP and TTP and the impact of using each others fitness function. Our experimental results suggest (1) that the W-TSP often can be solved better using the TTP fitness function and (2) final W-TSP and TTP solutions show different distributions when compared with optimal TSP or weighted greedy solutions.","['Evolutionary algorithms', 'Node weight dependent TSP', 'Traveling Thief Problem']",,en

We evolve instances with $$1\,000$$ nodes where the solvers show strongly different performance profiles. These instances serve as a basis for an exploratory study on the identification of well-discriminating problem characteristics (features). Our results in a nutshell: we show that even though (1) promising features exist, (2) these are in line with previous results from the literature, and (3) models trained with these features are more accurate than models adopting sophisticated feature selection methods, the advantage is not close to the virtual best solver in terms of penalized average runtime and so is the performance gain over the single best solver. However, we show that a feature-free deep neural network based approach solely based on visual representation of the instances already matches classical AS model results and thus shows huge potential for future studies.",Automated algorithm selection; Traveling Salesperson Problem; Feature-based approaches; Deep learning,"['Algorithmic skeletons, Domain-specific language, High-performance computing, Model-driven development, Parallel programming']",en
73995628,Evolving Sampling Strategies for One-Shot Optimization Tasks,"One-shot optimization tasks require to determine the set of solution candidates prior to their evaluation, i.e., without possibility for adaptive sampling. We consider two variants, classic one-shot optimization (where our aim is to find at least one solution of high quality) and one-shot regression (where the goal is to fit a model that resembles the true problem as well as possible). For both tasks it seems intuitive that well-distributed samples should perform better than uniform or grid-based samples, since they show a better coverage of the decision space. In practice, quasi-random designs such as Latin Hypercube Samples and low-discrepancy point sets are indeed very commonly used designs for one-shot optimization tasks. We study in this work how well low star discrepancy correlates with performance in one-shot optimization. Our results confirm an advantage of low-discrepancy designs, but also indicate the correlation between discrepancy values and overall performance is rather weak. We then demonstrate that commonly used designs may be far from optimal. More precisely, we evolve 24 very specific designs that each achieve good performance on one of our benchmark problems. Interestingly, we find that these specifically designed samples yield surprisingly good performance across the whole benchmark set. Our results therefore give strong indication that significant performance gains over state-of-the-art one-shot sampling techniques are possible, and that evolutionary algorithms can be an efficient means to evolve these.",One-shot optimization; Regression; Fully parallel search; Surrogate-assisted optimization; Continuous optimization,"['Nodes cooperation mechanism, Opportunistic networks, Privacy preserving routing, Public key sharing, Trust management']",en
73995721,One PLOT to Show Them All: Visualization of Efficient Sets in Multi-Objective Landscapes,"Visualization techniques for the decision space of continuous multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) are rather scarce in research. For long, all techniques focused on global optimality and even for the few available landscape visualizations, e.g., cost landscapes, globality is the main criterion. In contrast, the recently proposed gradient field heatmaps (GFHs) emphasize the location and attraction basins of local efficient sets, but ignore the relation of sets in terms of solution quality. In this paper, we propose a new and hybrid visualization technique, which combines the advantages of both approaches in order to represent local and global optimality together within a single visualization. Therefore, we build on the GFH approach but apply a new technique for approximating the location of locally efficient points and using the divergence of the multi-objective gradient vector field as a robust second-order condition. Then, the relative dominance relationship of the determined locally efficient points is used to visualize the complete landscape of the MOP. Augmented by information on the basins of attraction, this Plot of Landscapes with Optimal Trade-offs (PLOT) becomes one of the most informative multi-objective landscape visualization techniques available.",Multi-objective optimization; Continuous optimization; Visualization; Landscape analysis; Efficient sets,,en
73998890,Smart Energy Driven Business Model Innovation: An Analysis of Existing Business Models and Implications for Business Model Change in the Energy Sector,"Abstract: The Internet of Things in the energy sector manifests itself in the form of smart energy technologies that bring forth new smart energy business models (BMs). This technological progress alongside with decentralization of renewable energy production, market liberalization, and changing customer demands is making it difficult for organizations to keep up with the changing nature of the energy industry. Traditional energy utilities are challenged by the emerging smart energy BMs as the latter can replace established business operations. This is especially true for the customer segment of private households, which has become a focus of BM innovation in recent years. To address the challenge of low market transparency and the dynamics of technology-induced BM change, we analyze the BMs of 175 energy firms addressing the end consumer market by using a static (i.e., deriving BM representations) and dynamic BM lens (i.e., analysis of BM changes). We identify eight smart energy BM representations in form of BM archetypes. The findings are set in relation to a theoretical understanding of BM change revealing a hesitancy of traditional utilities to revise their BMs. Instead, the energy utilities prefer to build on BM extensions by outsourcing the innovation activities in subsidiaries or by using partnerships. The BM archetypes together with the BM changes provide an overview of the current smart energy market for private households and can serve as a starting point for BM innovation especially for energy utilities.",Smart energy business models; Smart grid business models; Internet of things business models; Business model innovation,,en

77542490,Empirical and theoretical perspectives in Sales and Operations Planning,"This paper’s purpose is to evaluate empirical and theoretical perspectives in Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP). The methodology consists of a systematic literature review, analysing 292 publications from academics and practitioners. The results reveal that the empirical evidence has been initially obtained by practitioners and subsequently acquired by academics with a growing interest in recent years. Three main research streams are identified: S&OP and performance, implementation of S&OP, and contextualisation of S&OP designs. The investigation of theoretical foundations reveals an upward trend in external general theory usage and first signs of internal theory development in S&OP. The research findings call for more exploratory research to enhance the knowledge in the identified research streams and their interrelation. Herein, applying the design science approach is recommended to integrate practitioners into academic research. Further implications embrace a call for more theory-informed empirical S&OP research in a two-prone agenda: applying general theories from other fields and developing internal theories through middle-range theorising. A limitation of this paper is its focus on empirical studies, not embracing conceptual papers. Applications of this paper’s findings can help academics and practitioners to advance their understanding of the S&OP phenomenon. The awareness of study findings in the three main research streams, combined with empirical and theoretical research implications, can support the development of solutions to improve the S&OP effectiveness and evidence-based decisions in real-life settings. This work’s originality lies in the analysis of the S&OP literature with the focus on the evolution of empirical evidence and the theoretical foundations.",Supply chain; Integrated business planning; Evidence-based management; Theory-informed research; Middle-range theory,"['Artificial Intelligence', ' Robots', ' Intelligent Machines', ' Humanity', ' Humanism', ' European']",en

In addition, we show how to efficiently sample uniformly at random from the set of all global optima. In our experimental study, we investigate how the number of optima develops for classical random benchmark instances dependent on their generator parameters. We find that the number of global optima can increase exponentially for practically relevant classes of instances with correlated weights and profits which poses a justification for the considered exact counting problem.",Zero-one knapsack problem; exact counting; sampling; dynamic programming,"['Design principles, Design science, Federalism, Public warning, Public warning system']",en

However, only a few academic papers shed light on the platforms' mechanisms. These mechanisms' opacity makes it hard for consumers to understand what happens with their data, and regulators struggle to implement effective regulations. Hence, we develop a taxonomy to understand and compare different characteristics of DMPs. Following Nickerson's (2013) method and combining an inductive and deductive approach, eight dimensions emerge that differentiate DMPs. We evaluate the taxonomy's applicability and test it with a set of nine DMPs, which we select by feasibility, relevance, and popularity. The application shows that the eight dimensions cover the significant features that explain most of the variance in characteristics between DMPs. The evaluation revealed opportunities for further development of the taxonomy.",data management platforms; targeted advertising; taxonomy; data economy,"['Citizen Journey', ' Dienstleistungsdesign', ' E-Government-Akzeptanz', ' Bürgerfreundlichkeit', ' Digitale Verwaltung']",en

Contrary to relational databases, often an explicit schema is optional and differently structured entities can be expected in the same data collection. If an explicit schema is absent, the consuming applications are forced to extract and make sense of the implicit schema without the support of the database itself. Automatic tools for systematic test case-generation currently do not support validating this error-prone procedure. To address this issue, we propose an approach applicable to NoSQL databases. We furthermore present a prototypical glass-box test generation tool, JaSoN, an extension of Symbolic Pathfinder for Java. JaSoN generates test cases for applications using MongoDB and accounts for different schema versions for entities of the same type. For this, the real MongoDB instance is replaced with a symbolic data store by mocking relevant MongoDB interfaces and combining this mock with custom Java bytecode.","symbolic execution, nosql, java pathfinder extension, versioned schema, test case generation, mongodb",,en
77555219,Uncovering data-flow anomalies in BPMN-based process-driven applications.,"Process-Driven Applications flourish through the interaction between an executable BPMN process model, human tasks, and external software services. All these components operate on shared process data, so it is even more important to check the correct data flow. However, data flow is in most cases not explicitly defined but hidden in model elements, form declarations, and program code. This paper elaborates on data-flow anomalies acting as indicators for potential errors and how such anomalies can be uncovered despite implicit and hidden data-flow definitions. By considering an integrated view, it goes beyond other approaches which are restricted to separate data-flow analysis of either process model or source code. The main idea is to merge call graphs representing programmed services into a control-flow representation of the process model, to label the resulting graph with associated data operations, and to detect anomalies in that labeled graph using a dedicated data-flow analysis. The applicability of the solution is demonstrated by a prototype designed for the Camunda BPM platform.","['BPMN', 'control-flow graph analysis', 'data-flow anomalies', 'process-driven application']","['COVID-19', ' Working From Home', ' Diary Study', ' Perceived Stress', ' Psychological Detachment', ' Communication Overload', ' Individual Focus Time']",en
77558595,Feature Development in BPMN-Based Process-Driven Applications,"In the context of Continuous Software Engineering, it is acknowledged as best practice to develop new features on the mainline rather than on separate feature branches. Unfinished work is then usually prevented from going live by some kind of feature toggle. However, there is no concept of feature toggles for Process-Driven Applications (PDA) so far. PDAs are hybrid systems consisting not only of classical source code but also of a machine-interpretable business process model. This paper elaborates on a feature development approach that covers both the business process model and the accompanying source code artifacts of a PDA. The proposed solution, Toggles for Process-Driven Applications (T4PDA), equipped with an easy to use modeling tool extension, enables the developer to safely commit unfinished work on model and source code to the project’s mainline. It will be kept inactive during productive deployments unless the feature is finally released. During an AB/BA crossover design experiment, the T4PDA approach, including the provided tool support, showed higher software quality, a faster development process, and contented developers.","['Continuous Software Engineering', 'Feature-driven development', 'Process-Driven Application']","['people analytics', ' IT artifact', ' archetypes', ' social network analytics', ' human resources analytics']",en

The public availability of data sets is thus a necessary precondition for reliable and replicable research. These data allow researchers to benchmark the computational methods they develop, test the generalizability of their findings, and build confidence in their results. When social media data are concerned, data sharing is often restricted for legal or privacy reasons, which makes the comparison of methods and the replicability of research results infeasible. Social media analytics research, consequently, faces an integrity crisis. How is it possible to create trust in computational or statistical analyses, when they cannot be validated by third parties? In this work, we explore this well-known, yet little discussed, problem for social media analytics. We investigate how this problem can be solved by looking at related computational research areas. Moreover, we propose and implement a prototype to address the problem in the form of a new evaluation framework that enables the comparison of algorithms without the need to exchange data directly, while maintaining flexibility for the algorithm design.","['benchmarking', 'reproducibility', 'social computing', 'social media analytics']","['Digitalisierung, Verwaltung, Verwaltungsreform, Staat, Wie ist der Staat auf Digitalisierung vorbereitet?, E-Government, Verwaltungsorganisation, Big Data, german politics']",en

We consider the classical vertex coloring problem on graphs and investigate the dynamic setting where edges are added to the current graph. We then analyze the expected time for randomized search heuristics to recompute high quality solutions. The (1+1) EA and RLS operate in a setting where the number of colors is bounded and we are minimizing the number of conflicts. Iterated local search algorithms use an unbounded color palette and aim to use the smallest colors and, consequently, the smallest number of colors. We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or even harder than optimization from scratch, i.e. starting with a random initialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems. However, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for others. In most cases our bounds show that reoptimization is faster than optimizing from scratch. We further show that tailoring mutation operators to parts of the graph where changes have occurred can significantly reduce the expected reoptimization time. In most settings the expected reoptimization time for such tailored algorithms is linear in the number of added edges. However, tailored algorithms cannot prevent exponential times in settings where the original algorithm is inefficient.","['Dynamic optimization', 'Evolutionary algorithms', 'Running time analysis']","['Database, Epigenetics, Genetics, Male infertility, Omics']",en

77601377,Generating Instances with Performance Differences for More Than Just Two Algorithms,"In recent years, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have frequently been adopted to evolve instances for optimization problems that pose difficulties for one algorithm while being rather easy for a competitor and vice versa. Typically, this is achieved by either minimizing or maximizing the performance difference or ratio which serves as the fitness function. Repeating this process is useful to gain insights into strengths/weaknesses of certain algorithms or to build a set of instances with strong performance differences as a foundation for automatic per-instance algorithm selection or configuration. We contribute to this branch of research by proposing fitness-functions to evolve instances that show large performance differences for more than just two algorithms simultaneously. As a proof-of-principle, we evolve instances of the multi-component Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) for three incomplete TTP-solvers. Our results point out that our strategies are promising, but unsurprisingly their success strongly relies on the algorithms' performance complementarity.","['evolutionary algorithms', 'evolving instances', 'fitness function', 'instance hardness', 'traveling thief problem (TTP)']","['Bytecode Analysis, Data Flow Analysis, Java Instrumentation']",en

77667317,Replication Study: Investigating Media Choice and Types of Media Collections of Distributed Workers Using Digital Traces,"Work is increasingly conducted in a distributed manner, enabled by a heterogeneous and growing set of digital communication and collaboration tools, which we call a media collection. This array of new digital collaboration tools with a trend towards multi-purpose integrated systems raises existing research on media collection choice into question. Based on a unique quantitative sample of digital traces, describing activity logs of tool use over a period of eight months, we replicate existing research. First, we identify the frequently used media collections and their purpose. Then, we test the association between two social factors, the assigned supervisor and coworkers, as well as physical location, with a worker's choice of a media collection. Our findings corroborate existing results that see information sharing as the dominant communication purpose in the identified media collections. Our data shows that the supervisor is strongly associated with an employee's choice of media collection, whereas coworkers and physical location are of little relevance in distributed work.",Media collections; Media choice; Digital traces; Distributed work; Replication study,"['Vertrauen', ' e-Services', ' digitale Verwaltung', ' e-Government', ' Citizen Journey', ' Customer Journey']",en
77667418,High-Level Parallel Ant Colony Optimization with Algorithmic Skeletons,"Parallel implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms such as the ant colony optimization (ACO) have been widely used to shorten the execution time when solving complex optimization problems. When aiming for a GPU environment, developing efficient parallel versions of such algorithms using CUDA can be a difficult and error-prone task even for experienced programmers. To overcome this issue, the parallel programming model of Algorithmic Skeletons simplifies parallel programs by abstracting from low-level features. This is realized by defining common programming patterns (e.g. map, fold and zip) that later on will be converted to efficient parallel code. In this paper, we show how algorithmic skeletons formulated in the domain specific language Musket can cope with the development of a parallel implementation of ACO and how that compares to a low-level implementation. Our experimental results show that Musket suits the development of ACO. Besides making it easier for the programmer to deal with the parallelization aspects, Musket generates high performance code with similar execution times when compared to low-level implementations.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'Ant colony optimization', 'High performance computing']","['Green IS', ' literature review', ' environmental sustainability', ' sustainable development goals', ' research directions']",en
77672639,Entropy-Based Evolutionary Diversity Optimisation for the Traveling Salesperson Problem,"Computing diverse sets of high-quality solutions has gained increasing attention among the evolutionary computation community in recent years. It allows practitioners to choose from a set of high-quality alternatives. In this paper, we employ a population diversity measure, called the high-order entropy measure, in an evolutionary algorithm to compute a diverse set of high-quality solutions for the Traveling Salesperson Problem. In contrast to previous studies, our approach allows diversifying segments of tours containing several edges based on the entropy measure. We examine the resulting evolutionary diversity optimisation approach precisely in terms of the final set of solutions and theoretical properties. Experimental results show significant improvements compared to a recently proposed edge-based diversity optimisation approach when working with a large population of solutions or long segments.","['Evolutionary algorithms', 'Evolutionary diversity optimisation', 'High-order entropy', 'Traveling salesperson problem']","['Deep Learning', ' Fitness Landscape', ' Exploratory Landscape Analysis', ' Continuous Black-Box Optimization']",en

77672839,Breeding Diverse Packings for the Knapsack Problem by Means of Diversity-Tailored Evolutionary Algorithms,"In practise, it is often desirable to provide the decision-maker with a rich set of diverse solutions of decent quality instead of just a single solution. In this paper we study evolutionary diversity optimization for the knapsack problem (KP). Our goal is to evolve a population of solutions that all have a profit of at least (1 - ϵ) · OPT, where OPT is the value of an optimal solution. Furthermore, they should differ in structure with respect to an entropy-based diversity measure. To this end we propose a simple (μ + 1)-EA with initial approximate solutions calculated by a well-known FPTAS for the KP. We investigate the effect of different standard mutation operators and introduce biased mutation and crossover which puts strong probability on flipping bits of low and/or high frequency within the population. An experimental study on different instances and settings shows that the proposed mutation operators in most cases perform slightly inferior in the long term, but show strong benefits if the number of function evaluations is severely limited.","['Evolutionary algorithms', 'Evolutionary diversity optimization', 'Knapsack problem', 'Tailored operators']","['When assessing the state of digitization', ' a look at other countries can be helpful', ' It is important to take contextual factors into account and to ensure that digital transformation is continuously accompanied and shaped and does not lead to more inequality in society']",en

Theoretical insights into the working principles of baseline evolutionary algorithms for diversity optimization are still rare. In this paper we study the well-known Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST) in the context of diversity optimization where population diversity is measured by the sum of pairwise edge overlaps. Theoretical results provide insights into the fitness landscape of the MST diversity optimization problem pointing out that even for a population of μ = 2 fitness plateaus (of constant length) can be reached, but nevertheless diverse sets can be calculated in polynomial time. We supplement our theoretical results with a series of experiments for the unconstrained and constraint case where all solutions need to fulfill a minimal quality threshold. Our results show that a simple (μ + 1)-EA can effectively compute a diversified population of spanning trees of high quality.","['Evolutionary algorithms', 'Evolutionary diversity optimization', 'Minimum spanning tree', 'Runtime analysis']","['deliberation', ' participation', ' design science research']",en

The DSL incorporates the idea of utilizing algorithmic skeletons, which are well-known patterns for parallel programming, such as map and reduce. Based on the chosen skeleton, a user-defined function can be applied to a data structure in parallel with the main advantage that the user does not have to worry about implementation details. So far, we had only implemented a generator for multi-core clusters and in this paper we present and evaluate two prototypes of generators for multi-GPU clusters, which are based on OpenACC and CUDA. We have evaluated the approach with four benchmark applications. The results show that the generation approach leads to execution times, which are on par with an alternative library implementation.","['Algorithmic skeletons', 'Domain-specific language', 'High-performance computing', 'Model-driven development', 'Parallel programming']","['e-Competences', ' Digital competences', ' e-Government', ' Digital government', ' Digital transformation']",en
77820493,Secure and privacy preserving structure in Opportunistic Networks,"Due to the lack of end to end connection in Opportunistic networks (OppNets), messages are sent from a node to another, from a source to a destination, opportunistically. The methodology of selecting the next intermediate nodes and providing security and privacy for nodes are the main challenging issues in designing an opportunistic network. In this paper, we propose a secure structure for OppNets wherein nodes can decide to carry a message without knowledge about the sender, destination, and intermediate nodes. While all nodes are not truthful in the network, a trust structure, a cooperation method, and a sharing public key approach are proposed. Furthermore, a routing algorithm is introduced to choose the best available nodes for forwarding messages. The proposed routing algorithm provides identity and location privacy for all nodes. The proposed structure offers messages confidentiality, data integrity, and privacy protection. Also, it resists against selfish and selective dropping attacks, and could prevent Sybil attacks. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the network in terms of better message delivery and less network overhead, latency, and messages drop.","['Nodes cooperation mechanism', 'Opportunistic networks', 'Privacy preserving routing', 'Public key sharing', 'Trust management']",,en
77831723,Supporting the Implementation of Predictive Maintenance – a Process Reference Model,"The perception of predictive maintenance as a proactive maintenance strategy to anticipate and reduce severe and costly failures and by thus increasing asset reliability has grown significantly in recent years. Due to the availability of machine sensor data and the intention to use these data in a purposeful way, the introduction of predictive maintenance provides a logical step towards maintenance optimization in industry. Several German industrial surveys highlight the growing interest in the topic by the majority of the addressed companies. Nevertheless, most of these companies are considering predictive maintenance on their future agenda and are currently only at the beginning of its implementation. This is, in many cases, due to missing internal knowledge and systematic guidance for maintenance practitioners. Existing process models and supportive guidance build on theoretical knowledge from experts; however, they often lack the complexity and challenges of industrial applications. In addition, most theoretical models focus on specific aspects of the entire process, target particular application areas, or present a few high-level steps. This paper, therefore, introduces the Process Reference Model for Predictive Maintenance (PReMMa), a comprehensive three-stage hierarchical process reference model for the implementation of predictive maintenance for industrial applications. The process reference model synthesizes existing process models as well as results from interviews with eleven practitioners from both management consultancies and experts from several industrial fields. With regard to four main phases and the predictive maintenance application, results are presented with consideration of the essential steps, their deliverables as well as the involved persons.",,,en

77924292,The Male Fertility Gene Atlas: a web tool for collecting and integrating OMICS data in the context of male infertility,"STUDY QUESTION: How can one design and implement a system that provides a comprehensive overview of research results in the field of epi-/genetics of male infertility and germ cells? SUMMARY ANSWER: Working at the interface of literature search engines and raw data repositories, the newly developed Male Fertility Gene Atlas (MFGA) provides a system that can represent aggregated results from scientific publications in a standardized way and perform advanced searches, for example based on the conditions (phenotypes) and genes related to male infertility. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: PubMed and Google Scholar are established search engines for research literature. Additionally, repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus and Sequence Read Archive provide access to raw data. Selected processed data can be accessed by visualization tools like the ReproGenomics Viewer. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The MFGA was developed in a time frame of 18 months under a rapid prototyping approach. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In the context of the Clinical Research Unit 'Male Germ Cells' (CRU326), a group of around 50 domain experts in the fields of male infertility and germ cells helped to develop the requirements engineering and feedback loops. They provided a set of 39 representative and heterogeneous publications to establish a basis for the system requirements. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The MFGA is freely available online at https://mfga.uni-muenster.de. To date, it contains 115 data sets corresponding to 54 manually curated publications and provides an advanced search function based on study conditions, meta-information and genes, whereby it returns the publications' exact tables and figures that fit the search request as well as a list of the most frequently investigated genes in the result set. Currently, study data for 31 different tissue types, 32 different cell types and 20 conditions are available. Also, ∼8000 and ∼1000 distinct genes have been found to be mentioned in at least 10 and 15 of the publications, respectively. LARGE SCALE DATA: Not applicable because no novel data were produced. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: For the most part, the content of the system currently includes the selected publications from the development process. However, a structured process for the prospective literature search and inclusion into the MFGA has been defined and is currently implemented. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The technical implementation of the MFGA allows for accommodating a wide range of heterogeneous data from aggregated research results. This implementation can be transferred to other diseases to establish comparable systems and generally support research in the medical field.","['Database', 'Epigenetics', 'Genetics', 'Male infertility', 'Omics']",,en

Thus, evaluating and generating test cases with respect to the data-flow coverage is desirable. Unfortunately, data-flow coverage is rarely considered in practice due to the lack of appropriate tools. Existing tools are typically based on static analysis and cannot distinguish between traversable and non-traversable data flows. They also have typically difficulties with properly handling aliasing and complex data structures. Thus, we propose a tool for dynamically analyzing the data-flow coverage which avoids all these drawbacks. In combination with our existing test-case generator, it enables the creation of an (almost) minimal set of test cases that guarantee all data flows to be covered.

Within this scope, design-oriented research, most notably within the Design Science Research (DSR) community, aims to provide solutions to these environmental challenges in the form of novel artifacts. The resulting IS solutions are valuable instruments for reducing emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and mitigating waste. Over the past 14 years, the IS research community was called upon multiple times to focus on designing solutions suitable for facilitating sustainability. However, it is unclear how these calls for action resonated within the design-oriented research community. Against this background, we analyzed the landscape of design-oriented GIS research by looking at 60 different GIS studies that have designed and evaluated an artifact. By analyzing these publications, we were able to make six observations. Based on these observations, we discuss how design-oriented GIS research can evolve to live up to the expectations of creating an immediate positive environmental impact",Green IS; literature review; environmental sustainability; sustainable development goals; research directions,"['content platform', ' content platform operator', ' platform approach', ' content provider', ' pipeline approach', ' media company', ' media regulation', ' value chain', ' value network', ' ecosystem', ' network effect', ' prosumer', ' user-generated content', ' content quality', ' media management', ' platform management']",en
79573672,A Collection of Deep Learning-based Feature-Free Approaches for Characterizing Single-Objective Continuous Fitness Landscapes,"<p>Exploratory Landscape Analysis is a powerful technique for numerically characterizing landscapes of single-objective continuous optimization problems. Landscape insights are crucial both for problem understanding as well as for assessing benchmark set diversity and composition. Despite the irrefutable usefulness of these features, they suffer from their own ailments and downsides. Hence, in this work we provide a collection of different approaches to characterize optimization landscapes. Similar to conventional landscape features, we require a small initial sample. However, instead of computing features based on that sample, we develop alternative representations of the original sample. These range from point clouds to 2D images and, therefore, are entirely feature-free. We demonstrate and validate our devised methods on the BBOB testbed and predict, with the help of Deep Learning, the high-level, expert-based landscape properties such as the degree of multimodality and the existence of funnel structures. The quality of our approaches is on par with methods relying on the traditional landscape features. Thereby, we provide an exciting new perspective on every research area which utilizes problem information such as problem understanding and algorithm design as well as automated algorithm configuration and selection.</p>",Deep Learning; Fitness Landscape; Exploratory Landscape Analysis; Continuous Black-Box Optimization,"['digital paywalls', ' online content', ' monetization', ' revenue models', ' pricing']",en
79586052,A Tale of Two Regulatory Regimes: Creation and Analysis of a Bilingual Privacy Policy Corpus,"<p>Over the past decade, researchers have started to explore the use of NLP to develop tools aimed at helping the public, vendors, and regulators analyze disclosures made in privacy policies. With the introduction of new privacy regulations, the language of privacy policies is also evolving, and disclosures made by the same organization are not always the same in different languages, especially when used to communicate with users who fall under different jurisdictions. This work explores the use of language technologies to capture and analyze these differences at scale. We introduce an annotation scheme designed to capture the nuances of two new landmark privacy regulations, namely the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA/CPRA. We then introduce the first bilingual corpus of mobile app privacy policies consisting of 64 privacy policies in English (292K words) and 91 privacy policies in German (478K words), respectively with manual annotations for 8K and 19K fine-grained data practices. The annotations are used to develop computational methods that can automatically extract ""disclosures"" from privacy policies. Analysis of a subset of 59 ""semi-parallel"" policies reveals differences that can be attributed to different regulatory regimes, suggesting that systematic analysis of policies using automated language technologies is indeed a worthwhile endeavor.<br /></p>",Privacy policy; Privacy policy corpus; Text corpus; Bilingual; GDPR; CCPA; CPRA,"['electronic marketing', ' benefits and costs', ' technology adoption', ' theory of reasoned action', ' voice assistant', ' voice commerce']",en

79625073,Technology Lifecycles and Digital Technologies: Patterns of Discourse across Levels of Materiality,"<p>The technology lifecycle model is extensively used to study technology evolution and innovation. However, this model was developed for industrial-age material technologies and does not address digital technologies with nonmaterial elements. Therefore, a question emerges as to whether the level of technological materiality is implicated in different dynamics of innovation, as reflected in the technology lifecycle. Digital technologies evolve through discourse that involves interactions among multiple stakeholders that shape the evolutionary trajectory of the technology. Therefore, we set out to examine whether discourse about digital technologies that vary in their level of materiality manifests in different ways throughout these technologies’ lifecycles. To do so, we conducted a study comparing the discourse around 10 digital technologies—five highly material and five highly nonmaterial—at different stages of their technology lifecycles. We identified three characteristics of discourse—volume, volatility, and diversity—and examined them for the 10 digital technologies by analyzing their corresponding Wikipedia articles. Our findings show that the discourse around technologies with different levels of materiality is similar in the initial era of the lifecycle but diverges in the two subsequent eras. In addition, we found that the discourse around highly nonmaterial technologies remains elevated for longer time periods, compared to highly material technologies. Based on these results, we put forth propositions that challenge and extend existing research on the relationships between the technological level of materiality, discourse, and trajectories of technology evolution.<br /></p>",Digital technologies,"['virtual reality glasses', ' technology adoption', ' hedonic information system', ' personality']",en

To keep up with this development, public officials are required to obtain and improve so-called e-competences. In order to determine developments in the perceived relevance of those competences over the past five years, we have set up a comparative survey study investigating (a) how the perceived importance of certain e-competences has developed (b) whether the supply of professionals holding certain e-competences has changed and (c) whether there is a change in public sector employees being sent to relevant training. The survey was filled out in 2016 and 2021. Out of 54 inquired variables, 29 show a statistically significant increase. From the employees’ perspective, we found a perceived increase in the importance and demand of e-competences and a decrease in having enough professionals available holding these e-competences.",e-Competences; Digital competences; e-Government; Digital government; Digital transformation,"['Content Marketing', ' Owned Media', ' Formate', ' Glaubwürdigkeit']",en

However, only aggregated demographic data is available for most geographic regions. Furthermore, the infectious disease application case can require the fusion of multiple data sources (e.g. census and public health statistics), inducing demand for a modular and extensible modeling approach. In this work we provide a novel sequential sample-free approach to generate synthetic baseline populations for agent-based simulations, combining synthetic reconstruction and combinatorial optimization. We applied the approach to generate a population model for the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (17.5 million inhabitants) which yielded an average accuracy of around 98% per attribute. The resulting population model is publicly available and has been utilized in multiple simulation-based infectious disease case studies. We suggest that our research can pave the way for more geographically granular synthetic populations to be used in model-driven infectious disease epidemics prediction and prevention.",,"['e-commerce', ' business models', ' retailers', ' media companies', ' content-driven commerce']",en

Compared to text-based interaction, speech is natural and intuitive, which is why companies use VAs in customer service. However, we do not yet know for which kinds of tasks speech is beneficial. Drawing on task-technology fit theory, we present a research model to examine the applicability of VAs to different tasks. To test this model, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 116 participants who had to complete an information search task with a VA or a chatbot. The results show that speech exhibits higher perceived efficiency, lower cognitive effort, higher enjoyment, and higher service satisfaction than text-based interaction. We also find that these effects depend on the task’s goal-directedness. These findings extend task-technology fit theory to customers’ choice of interaction modalities and inform practitioners about the use of VAs for information search tasks.",voice assistant; conversational agent; speech interaction; cognitive fit; customer service,,en

Virtual Reality verspricht für dieses als Co-Creation bezeichnetes Vorgehen viele Vorteile. So können Kundinnen und Kunden z. B. ein virtuelles Produktabbild untersuchen und anpassen, bevor das Produkt tatsächlich produziert wird. Es ist bislang jedoch unklar, wie sich der Einsatz von Virtual Reality auf das Co-Creation-Erlebnis der Kundinnen und Kunden auswirkt, welches entscheidend für das Ergebnis eines Co-Creation-Prozesses ist. Eine besondere Rolle fällt hierbei der Immersion als das Eintauchen in eine virtuelle Aufgabe und Schlüsseleigenschaft von VR zu. Dieser Artikel beschreibt die Ergebnisse einer Laborstudie, in der die Teilnehmenden ein neuartiges Hotelzimmerdesign in einer speziellen Virtual Reality-Anwendung entworfen haben. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Immersion starke und signifikant positive Effekte auf das Co-Creation-Erlebnis der Kundinnen und Kunden hat, was sich in ihrem Vergnügen, ihrer Handlungskompetenz und ihrer Autonomie ausdrückt. Zusätzlich zeigen unsere Ergebnisse, dass Vergnügen und Autonomie zur Zufriedenheit mit dem Co-Creation-Prozess beitragen, Handlungskompetenz jedoch nicht. Schließlich identifizierten wir Interaktivität und Telepräsenz als Haupttreiber der Immersion. Unsere Ergebnisse haben wichtige Implikationen für Unternehmen, die versuchen, Kundinnen und Kunden in Innovationsprozesse und speziell in die Entwicklung neuer Produkte und Dienste zu integrieren.

79716456,Content-driven Commerce - Empirical Studies of the IT-enabled Convergence of Two Business Model Types,"Content and commerce are usually referred to as two different business model types on the Internet. While content comprises the aggregation, bundling, and distribution of informative, entertaining,or educating content, commerce is understood as the sale of goods and services. However, content and commerce are becoming increasingly intertwined.From one side, media companies are trying to use content for the initiation of product sales to participate in revenues (revenue sharing). From the other side, online retailers have realized that they need content to make their stores more appealing for customers and to establish a relationship with them (content-driven commerce). The question therefore arises whether content is a decisive success factor for online retailers. At the same time, media companies are faced with the challenge to initiate transactions with their content in a profitable way without neglecting the content&rsquo;s original purpose.The present dissertation examines the relationship between content and commerce in three empirical studies from different perspectives.

79734999,Watch Me Improve—Algorithm Aversion and Demonstrating the Ability to Learn,"Owing to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically in machine learning, information technology (IT) systems can support humans in an increasing number of tasks. Yet, previous research indicates that people often prefer human support to support by an IT system, even if the latter provides superior performance &ndash; a phenomenon called algorithm aversion. A possible cause of algorithm aversion put forward in literature is that users lose trust in IT systems they become familiar with and perceive to err, for example, making forecasts that turn out to deviate from the actual value. Therefore, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of demonstrating an AIbased system&rsquo;s ability to learn as a potential countermeasure against algorithm aversion in an incentive-compatible online experiment. The experiment reveals how the nature of an erring advisor (i.e., human vs. algorithmic), its familiarity to the user (i.e., unfamiliar vs. familiar), and its ability to learn (i.e., non-learning vs. learning) influence a decision maker&rsquo;s reliance on the advisor&rsquo;s judgement for an objective and non-personal decision task. The results reveal no difference in the reliance on unfamiliar human and algorithmic advisors, but differences in the reliance on familiar human and algorithmic advisors that err. Demonstrating an advisor&rsquo;s ability to learn, however, offsets the effect of familiarity. Therefore, this study contributes to an enhanced understanding of algorithm aversion and is one of the first to examine how users perceive whether an IT system is able to learn. The findings provide theoretical and practical implications for the employment and design of AI-based systems.",algorithm aversion; artificial intelligence; machine learning; decision support; advice taking,,en

Despite various approaches to reduce the required cognitive efforts and time, knowledge externalization remains challenging. However, recent technological advances in automatic speech recognition and natural language processing enable information technology systems to improve knowledge externalization by listening to conversations and processing their content. In this study, we employ a design science approach to examine how speech-based systems should be designed to assist knowledge externalization. Employing the use case of creating meeting protocols, we built a high-fidelity prototype of a speech-based protocol system and demonstrated it in two exploratory online focus groups. Based on this data, we describe the problem space of creating protocols and develop six design principles guiding the design of speech-based protocol systems.

A potential lever to counter the loss of trust is a more transparent decisionmaking basis of such autonomous systems. Yet, the effect of transparency on trust may be ambivalent as the quality revealed by transparency may vary, potentially enhancing or reducing trust. To shed light on the (joint) effect of transparency and quality on trust in robo-advisors, we conduct an experiment in which participants interact with a manipulated robo-advisor representation. We find strong positive effects of transparency and quality on trust and a negative interaction revealing their substitutive capacity. Surprisingly, transparency proves particularly trust-enhancing in cases of low quality. Based on these findings, we derive theoretical and practical implications enhancing our understanding of interactions with increasingly autonomous decision support.",robo-advisor; transparency; quality; trust,"['business model', ' SME', ' product innovation']",en

Towards a Better Understanding of How Personalization and Self-Reference Drive News Sharing,"Along with the continuing shift from traditional to digital news consumption, many news consumers share news via social networks and messaging services. Hence, news providers benefit from an increase in user involvement and a growing awareness of their news offerings. Although personalizing digital news offerings has become common practice, we know little about how personalization affects news sharing. Building on the stimulus-organism-response model, we propose a comprehensive framework to investigate how personalization and self-referential cues impact users&rsquo; sharing intention mediated by their cognitive and affective reactions. To test our research model, we conduct an experiment with a fictitious news application and analyze the results using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results reveal that personalization and self-reference impact users&rsquo; perceived preference fit and perceived enjoyment, which in turn drive news sharing. The findings have important implications for researchers and news providers.",electronic marketing; digital news; personalization; self-reference; sharing; social referrals,,en

Most news publishers thereby follow freemium model paradigms, simultaneously offering free and paid content. The most prominent paywall configurations to distinguish between free and paid content are choice and quantity restrictions. While prior research examined how paywall introductions affect website traffic, there is little knowledge about the effectiveness of these paywall configurations in converting non-paying users into paying customers. The results of our online experiment suggest that restricting the choice of free articles is more effective in driving conversions than restricting their quantity. A mediation analysis reveals that two counteracting mechanisms in consumers&rsquo; decision making contribute to explaining conversion interest: a positive effect of psychological reactance and a negative effect of product fit uncertainty. We conclude with design implications for optimizing digital paywall configurations.",digital paywalls; paywall configurations; sampling; freemium; content monetization,,en

As companies offer customers the possibility of communicating with them via VAs, it is important to determine the kind of tasks for which this interaction modality is beneficial. Drawing on cognitive fit and task-technology fit theory, we present a research model for examining the fit between speech- and text-based interaction modalities and task characteristics. To test this model, we propose a mixed design laboratory experiment with interaction modality serving as between-subject factor and task type serving as within-subject factor. For this purpose, we developed a VA using DialogFlow and trained it in two pre-tests. The results of the experiment will extend theory on cognitive fit and provide practical insight regarding the applicability of speech.",voice assistant; conversational agent; speech interaction; cognitive fit,,en
79735608,Content platforms,"The term media company has originally been associated with firms creating, bundling, or distributing content in a linear communication process with consumers as recipients. Such companies can also be referred to as content providers. However, the advancement of digital information and communication technologies has given rise to a new way of organizing communication processes, namely content platforms. These platforms do not create content themselves but offer users the opportunity to publish content for the reception by other users. A focal role in the resulting ecosystem is obtained by the platform operator. In this chapter, we introduce content platform operators as a new type of media company and distinguish them from content providers. Based on examples from practice, we shed light on the relationship between content providers and content platform operators. Furthermore, we look at specifics in managing content platforms, which includes attracting users, ensuring content quality, running the platform, and capturing value from these activities.

79742544,Monetizing Online Content: Digital Paywall Design and Configuration,"The media industry was among the first affected by digitization, because digital technologies have changed content production, distribution, and consumption profoundly. Most media companies have suffered revenue losses, being unable to adapt their monetization strategies to the rapidly changing media consumption patterns of their recipients. Additionally, advertising revenues have proven to be a less reliable revenue source in online than in offline media markets. Consequently, a major obstacle to the content providers&rsquo; successful digital transformation is the establishment of sustainable revenue streams (Chyi2012). The market for music and video content reveals a trend toward direct monetization, with subscription-based streaming services such as Spotify or Netflix showing increasing revenues. However, other media markets, including the market for news content, still struggle to monetize their content online (PricewaterhouseCoopers2019). After extensive experimentation with various monetization approaches and several failed attempts, more and more news content providers adoptdigital paywallsto counter the impending market trends. While the term digital paywall is commonly used in the context of news content, the functionality of this instrument to govern consumers&rsquo; access to online content is also important for other media products such as music, videos, or games. However, a standard digital paywall does not exist. Owing to the wide range of and new developments in configuration options, the limited experience with digital paywalls in practice, and a lack of research on this topic, it is still unclear which factors determine the optimal design of a digital paywall.",digital paywalls; online content; monetization; revenue models; pricing,"['Integrated Business Planning', ' Supply Chain', ' Cross-functional Integration']",en

However, customers are reluctant to use their VAs for shopping; a tendency not explained by extant literature. Therefore, this research aims to understand consumers&rsquo; perceived benefits and costs when using voice commerce, based on a theoretical framework derived from prior literature and the theory of reasoned action. We evaluated and extended this framework by analyzing 30 semi-structured interviews with smart speaker users. According to our results voice commerce consumers perceive benefits in terms of efficiency, convenience, and enjoyment, and criticize the perceived costs of limited transparency, lack of trust, lack of control, and low technical maturity. The resulting model sheds light on the promoters and inhibitors of voice commerce and provides guidelines that enable practitioners to design and improve voice commerce applications.",electronic marketing; benefits and costs; technology adoption; theory of reasoned action; voice assistant; voice commerce,"['Cross-Functional Integration', ' Global Integrated Business Planning', ' Supply Chain Integration']",en

However, prior research shows that decision-makers tend to prefer human decision support despite the superiority of algorithms. Further, individuals prefer retaining control of decisions despite increased effort. We propose a model explaining underlying considerations of these paradoxes in decision support acceptance. In a vignette-based experiment in the context of investment management, we test the model to explain trade-offs in varying levels of automation and user control and analyze effects on the intention to utilize decision support. Results provide support for a positive effect of automation on performance expectancy and a negative effect of user control on perceived risk.

A key area of application is AI-based digital assistants, which are now becoming available in large numbers and a wide variety of usage scenarios. Research into AI-based digital assistants has a long history, dating back to Joseph Weizenbaum&rsquo;s well-known ELIZA in 1966. In parallel, global technology companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Amazon have been working intensively for decades on advancing AI-based digital assistants and have recently made them suitable for the mass market. Empowered by recent advances in AI, these assistants are becoming part of our daily lives. We are observing the ever-growing usage of various digital assistants, for instance, voice-based assistants such as Amazon Alexa, or text-based assistants (chatbots), such as those embedded in Facebook Messenger. It is foreseen that AI-based digital assistants will become a key element in the future of work.Today&rsquo;s enterprise communication platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams already provide many different bot types to augment work, andGartner (2019) predicts that by 2021, one-quarter of all digital workers will use a virtual employee assistant daily.",,,en
79743251,A Classification of Decision Automation and Delegation in Digital Investment Management Systems,"Digital investment management systems, commonly known as robo-advisors, provide new alternatives to traditional human services, offering competitive investment returns at lower cost and customer effort. However, users must give up control over their investments and rely on automated decision-making. Because humans display aversion to high levels of automation and delegation, it is important to understand the interplay of these two aspects. This study proposes a taxonomy of digital investment management systems based on their levels of decision automation and delegation along the investment management process. We find that the degree of automation depends on the frequency and urgency of decisions as well as the accuracy of algorithms. Notably, most providers only invest in a subset of funds pre-selected by humans, potentially limiting efficiency gains. Based on our taxonomy, we identify archetypical system designs, which facilitate further research on perception and adoption of digital investment management systems.",digital services and the digitalization of services; decision analytics; mobile services; service science; autonomous systems; decision automation; decision delegation; robo advisory; taxonomy,"['Digital Transformation', ' Small and Medium-sized Enterprises', ' Steel Industry']",en

Despite the recent public and academic interest in AI, AI-enabled systems are not a new phenomenon. However, previous research is separated into research streams on different AI-enabled system types. We conducted a literature review to aggregate the dispersed knowledge regarding individual user interaction with such systems in IS research. Our results show common behavioral patterns in interactions between users and various types of AIenabled systems and provide a solid foundation for future research on this topic.",artificial intelligence; AI-enabled systems; user interactiuon; literature review,,en

In the light of this development, the information systems (IS) discipline has been criticized for dedicating insufficient research effort to these types of system, which are referred to as hedonic IS. Therefore, we conducted a descriptive literature review within the top 40 IS journals to summarize past research on hedonic IS and to identify research gaps. To structure our analysis, we separated the studies in our sample between those taking a user and those taking a provider perspective, assigned them to the phases of two life cycle models, and categorized the studies according to the investigated system type. The results reveal that hedonic IS research mostly takes a user perspective, predominantly addresses the (continued) use phase of the user life cycle, and investigates five different system types. Based on our findings, we point out promising opportunities for future research. Thus, our review may help researchers to plan further studies on hedonic IS.",hedonic IS; IS discipline; literature review; IS life cycle,,en

An Examination of the Factors Influencing User Loyalty towards News Websites,"Owing to the increased competition in electronic markets, customer loyalty has become an important success factor in e-business. However, the antecedents of customer loyalty differ between business domains. While the formation of customer loyalty in e-commerce has been studied extensively, little is known about how loyalty towards news websites develops. Integrating findings from uses and gratifications research into DeLone and McLean&rsquo;s theory on information systems success, we built a quality-value-satisfaction-loyalty chain for news websites. To test our research model, we conducted a survey and applied partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results reveal that loyalty towards news websites depends on both utilitarian and hedonic value perceptions, which, in turn, are influenced by content quality.

The rapid diffusion of VR glasses holds the potential to disrupt the way media is consumed. Yet little is known about their acceptance by consumers. This study seeks to explore the user acceptance of VR glasses, considering the specifics of hedonic information systems in consumer settings. Focusing on user personality, namely the users&rsquo; desire to escape reality, we developed a framework based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and tested it in a laboratory study with 155 participants. The structural equation model results show that VR glasses&rsquo; ability to induce presence, a sense of being in another environment, is a key characteristic of the technology that influences the adoption. We found the users&rsquo; escapism tendency to be a distinctive user personality trait for determining the adoption of VR glasses. Our study provides insights into the adoption of technology in early diffusion stages and the role of technology characteristics and personality traits in adoption decisions.

79745885,Media Meets Retail – Re-evaluating Content Quality in the Context of B2C E-commerce,"In the increasingly competitive Internet business landscape, content is more and more employed for marketing purposes. While online retailers are raising investments in content to promote their online shops, media companies are starting to monetize their content by building own e-commerce platforms. The rationale behind these content-driven commerce approaches is to create a satisfying online shopping experience and, thus, to foster customer loyalty. However, whether content is a suitable means to these ends has not yet been proven. One obstacle is that there is no measurement instrument that captures all relevant characteristics of content on a website. We seek to fill this gap by developing a unified content quality scale in the context of B2C e-commerce. In this paper, we report on the first two of five steps in the scale development process and provide an initial proposal for a formativeformative second-order content quality construct. In contrast to previous measures, our scale considers hedonic characteristics of content and thus contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the concept. Furthermore, both media companies and online retailers can benefit from this scale by applying it to evaluate the effects of their content-driven commerce approaches on customer satisfaction and loyalty.",content quality; content-driven commerce; scale development; hedonic IS use,"['Covid', ' Online', ' Lehre', ' Prozessmanagement']",en

Using content to drive sales of related products or services such as in affiliate marketing or content-driven commerce appears to be a promising solution for this issue. However, these commerce-oriented revenue models may cast doubt on the credibility of the content, which is an important success factor for the providers. Drawing upon credibility concepts and information processing theories from communication science, we conducted a vignette-based online experiment to investigate whether content credibility is affected by the provider&rsquo;s revenue model. Participants in the experiment were shown a screenshot of a website, which was monetized either by advertising, affiliate marketing or content-driven commerce. Our results indicate that content credibility in the affiliate marketing scenario was higher than in the content-driven commerce or the advertising scenario. A mediation analysis revealed that this effect was mediated by the content provider&rsquo;s trustworthiness. Our findings shed light on the relationship between credibility and monetization of content on the Internet. Moreover, they are helpful for practitioners in the media industry in designing optimal revenue generation strategies.",content credibility; revenue models; content-driven commerce; affiliate marketing,"['Simulation', ' Optimization', ' Blood Supply Chain']",en

Such services involve e-vehicle owners and a provider of energy trading skills, where the latter manages e-vehicle (dis-)charging at real-time energy prices. We propose and evaluate a data-driven optimization approach for the operational management of services that address e-vehicle owners with uncertain mobility demand and with a solar generator. We formulate the management problem as a sequential decision problem, and propose to solve it by integrating a lookahead policy with a safety energy buffering approach. We study by computer simulation the economic sustainability and the practical viability of the services under different degrees of mobility demand uncertainty, and for different e-vehicle owner types. We assess the negative impact of the uncertainty on both financial value and mobility demand satisfaction of the services. We show that our optimization approach with time-dependent energy buffering enables high mobility demand satisfaction while achieving, even in the case of extreme mobility demand uncertainty, on average at least 92% of the financial value that can be achieved under quasi-deterministic mobility demand. We show that combining our approach with departure time flexibility is sufficient to reach perfect mobility demand satisfaction and a further increase of the financial value.","['E-vehicle services', 'Energy buffering', 'Energy management', 'Energy trading', 'Mobility demand uncertainty', 'Sustainable transport']",,en

Furthermore, the variety of product categoriesand review websites these studies receive their information from is rather limited. The results reveal that previous research can only provide an imperfect understanding of the impact of electronic word-of-mouth on business .

79785774,Towards Feature-Free Automated Algorithm Selection for Single-Objective Continuous Black-Box Optimization,"We propose a novel method for automated algorithm selection in the domain of single-objective continuous black-box optimization. In contrast to existing methods, we use convolutional neural networks as the selection apparatus which bases its decision on a so-called 'fitness map'. This fitness map is a 2D representation of a two dimensional search space where different gray scales indicate the quality of found solutions in certain areas. Our devised approach uses a modular CMA-ES framework which offers the option to create the conventional CMA-ES, CMA-ES with the alternate step-size adaptation and many other variants proposed over the years. In total, 4 608 different configurations are possible where most configurations are of complementary nature. In this proof-of-concept work, we consider a subset of 32 possible configurations. The developed method is evaluated against an excerpt of BBOB functions and its performance is compared against baselines that are commonly used in automated algorithm selection - the best standalone algorithm (configuration) and the best obtainable sequence of configurations. While the results indicate that the use of the fitness map is not superior on every benchmark problem, it indubitably shows its merit on more hard-to-solve problems. This offers a promising perspective for generalizing to other types of optimization problems and problem domains.","['Automated Algorithm Configuration', 'Black-Box Optimization', 'CMA-ES', 'Deep Learning', 'Feature-Free']",,en
79815939,Input Selection for Bandwidth-Limited Neural Network Inference,"<p>Data are often accommodated on centralized storage servers. This is the 
case, for instance, in remote sensing and astronomy, where projects 
produce several petabytes of data every year. While machine learning 
models are often trained on relatively small subsets of the data, the 
inference phase typically requires transferring significant amounts of 
data between the servers and the clients. In many cases, the bandwidth 
available per user is limited, which then renders the data transfer to 
be one of the major bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a framework 
that automatically selects the relevant parts of the input data for a 
given neural network. The model as well as the associated selection 
masks are trained simultaneously such that a good model performance is 
achieved while only a minimal amount of data is selected. During the 
inference phase, only those parts of the data have to be transferred 
between the server and the client. We propose both instance-independent 
and instance-dependent selection masks. The former ones are the same for
 all instances to be transferred, whereas the latter ones allow for 
variable transfer sizes per instance. Our experiments show that it is 
often possible to significantly reduce the amount of data needed to be 
transferred without affecting the model quality much.</p>",deep learning; big data; satellite data,,en

In the most advanced case, the no-stop shop, clients do not have to do anything to receive a public service. Public organizations offer many services and several of them could potentially be delivered through a no-stop shop. Therefore, public organizations need assistance in the decision which services they realize in a no-stop shop first. To address this issue, we present a method for the prioritization of public services for the implementation in a no-stop shop. The rationale of our method is that public organizations should prefer those services that are expected to provide the highest public value.

problems with picking, loading, and soft time windows. This general type
 of vehicle routing problem is of particular relevance in the same-day 
delivery context, in which fast routing algorithms are required because 
of the commitment to real-time delivery in the presence of high customer
 order frequencies. To boost the performance of the branch-and-price 
algorithms, we introduce the new method of tree-compatible labeling with
 nondominance trees. This method represents cost functions by a fixed 
number of breakpoints and uses a specialized tree-based data structure 
to store Pareto-optimal labels. We prove the theoretical soundness of 
the new method and evaluate its performance numerically with respect to 
pricing, column generation, and branch-and-price. Our numerical results 
show that the method yields substantial performance gains. In 
particular, we show that, with the new method, branch-and-price is able 
to reliably generate within a few minutes close to optimal solutions for
 problem instances with 50 customers. By additional experiments with 
classic vehicle routing problems with hard time windows, we show that 
the performance gains of our method result from its ability to handle 
cost functions in the pricing step. Our approach is the first 
branch-and-price approach for vehicle routing with picking, loading, and
 soft time windows. As such, it represents an exact routing algorithm 
that is able to reliably satisfy the runtime requirements of real-time

However, precise measurements, such as from airborne or spaceborne 3D laser scanning (LiDAR), are expensive and usually cover only small areas. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning model that can generate detailed maps of tree canopy heights. In contrast to previous approaches that use a single image as input, we process multi-temporal data via a an adaptation of the popular U-Net architecture that is based on the EfficientNet and 3D convolution operators. To that end, our model receives multi-spectral Landsat satellite imagery as input and can predict continuous height maps. As labeled data, we resort to spatially sparse LiDAR data from ICESat-2. Thus, with such a model, one can produce dense canopy height maps given only multi-spectral Landsat data. Our experimental evaluation shows that our our model outperforms existing and improved single-temporal models. To test generalizability, we created a non-overlapping dataset to evaluate our approach and further tested the model performance on out-of-distribution data. The results show that our model can successfully learn drastic changes in distribution.","['Canopy Height Prediction', 'ICESat-2', 'Landsat', 'Neural Networks', 'Spatio-Temporal Data']",,en

Looking at the transition of a digital invention to digital innovation, we argue for a technology-affinity perspective to complement existing adoption perspectives. The new perspective emphasizes the role of conscious invention design for innovation. We find three ways in which specific invention focus can increase the invention's chances for adoption. For instance, we show that contrary to the prevalent idea of technologies enabling new ways of doing things, it is the invention's focus on enabling innate behaviors that can facilitate adoption.

Even with applications that are instantiated multiple times as stand-alone configured versions of a same application for different clients or purposes, the deployment requires organizations to allocate developers’ time and know-how to navigate the complex process of submitting application instances to different platforms. We extend the body of knowledge on cross-platform applications, which is currently dominated by literature covering aspects of application development, with a dedicated approach for cross-platform application deployment. Our approach enables non-technical roles in an organization to trigger a ‘one-click’ workflow for deploying instantiable cross-platform applications and applies to various scenarios in which stand-alone configurations of the same applications are required. The approach spurs academic inquiries into application deployment and has practical implications for organizations that want to streamline their application deployment, reduce required resources, and improve deployment efficiency.<br /></p>","Software Development for Mobile Devices, the Internet-of-Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems, app, application, cross-platform, deployment, mobile",,en

79940453,The role of finance in the Sales and Operations Planning process: a multiple case study,"Purpose: This paper aims to offer evidence-based findings on the under-researched role of finance in the sales and operations planning (S&OP) process, aiming to guide academics and practitioners towards successful S&OP implementations. Design/methodology/approach: The research builds upon a multiple case study, embracing five Latin American subsidiaries of four global manufacturing corporations from the consumer goods, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following an exploratory approach, the case study results are analysed in within- and cross-case analyses. Findings: The research findings are synthesised into a framework, demonstrating relevant benefits from the engagement of finance along the S&OP process and the implications of its interactions with traditional S&OP functions as sales, marketing and operations. The paper shows how finance adds value in supporting the process, enabling decisions on costs, margins, capital expenditures and return on investments. Finance strengthens S&OP when assessing demand- and supply-related risks and facilitates comparing the functional business areas' plans to budget. While finance participation is highlighted as necessary for supporting successful S&OP implementations, it also receives valuable inputs in return, characterising a two-way communication role that benefits the entire organisation. Originality/value: This is the first research paper focusing on empirically exploring the role of finance within S&OP, going beyond initial insights from practice and academia. It provides practitioners and scholars with an in-depth, evidence-based view of finance's integration along the S&OP process.",Integrated Business Planning; Supply Chain; Cross-functional Integration,"['Business intelligence, Business process engineering, Case study, Decision support, IT incident management, Knowledge management, Latent dirichlet allocation, Text mining']",en
79940554,Global sales and operations planning: A multinational manufacturing company perspective,"The purpose of this paper is to analyse the global Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process and investigate the steps to support consolidated business planning in worldwide operations and large-scale supply chains. The paper conducts a case study at a multinational manufacturing company applying an abductive approach. It combines the deductive logic from theory and the inductive logic from field observation in an attempt to elaborate further on theory on global S&OP. The analysis is structured and guided by a novel framework for global S&OP, which is developed based on the theoretical background and the case study findings. The research findings characterise the S&OP process for global operations and identify challenges related to the need to synchronise the subsidiaries' S&OP efforts worldwide to deal with different contingencies of these subsidiaries, and to manage and analyse a large amount of information gathered. The research reveals how the subsidiaries' performance is analysed by top executives along the global S&OP process, feeding strategic initiatives in the organisation and identifying business opportunities like benchmarking among subsidiaries, synergies with other management practices, and global gains. This paper offers a novel investigation of the global steps on S&OP in a real-life setting, offering a well-documented characterisation of the process that goes beyond the traditional local approach. Moreover, it is the first study to reveal challenges and expected outcomes of such a global perspective for S&OP. The theoretical advancements of S&OP research offered herein aid scholars, opening avenues for middle-range theorising, highlighting the cross-disciplinary nature of the domain, and discussing the use of concepts from related disciplines like Economics, Psychology, and Information Systems. The research findings can also assist executives, especially from multinational manufacturers, in their efforts to consolidate global planning.",Cross-Functional Integration; Global Integrated Business Planning; Supply Chain Integration,"['Carsharing, Location-based services, Spatial analytics, Visualization']",en

79963395,Using Simulation to Leverage Digital Transformation of SMEs: A European Perspective,"<p>Digital transformation is one of the main challenges that SMEs face nowadays. Nevertheless, to a great extent, they lack the necessary capacities and skills to introduce and apply technologies that can support digitalization. As a design science approach, researchers from different European countries have carried out the collaborative research project VOIL to collect and scientifically develop resources and tools to support SMEs in building digital skills. In the context of this project, a tool is developed to assess the digital maturity of SMEs. Moreover, a learning journey based on the use of simulators is proposed together with a minimal viable prototype integrating all developed tools to provide a comprehensive learning environment. Lessons learned from the application of said learning online environment in experimental settings are also shared. The project results contribute to the research that has been carried out within the scope of life long learning, proposing the aggregation of pedagogical strategies that allow self-guided learning in the workplace.<br /></p>",Making Digital Transformation Real; digital skills; digital transformation; emerging technologies; learning journey; simulation-based learning,"['Carsharing, Data analysis, Decision support, Location-based services, Visualization']",en

In this article, we propose a new computational system based on the &lsquo;Fuzzy Extended Analytic Hierarchy Process (FEAHP)&rsquo; method for supplier selection while considering the relevant risks. We sought to evaluate the opportunities and limitations of using the FEAHP method in supplier selection and analyzed the support of the system developed through the real case of a Brazilian oil and natural gas company. The computational approach based on FEAHP automates supplier selection by determining a hierarchy of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. First, the criteria and sub-criteria specific to the selection problem were identified by the experts taking the relevant literature as a starting point. Next, the experts performed a pair-wise comparison of the predefined requirements using a linguistic scale. This evaluation was then quantified by calculating the priority weights of criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The best decision alternative is the one with the highest final score. Sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the results of the proposed model. The FEAHP computer approach automated the supplier selection process in a rational, flexible, and agile way, as perceived by the focal company. From this, we hypothesized that using this system can provide helpful insights in choosing the best suppliers in an environment of risk and uncertainty, thereby maximizing supply chain performance.",,"['Business Intelligence, Decision Support, E-Mobility, Smart City Planning']",en

An Exploratory Study on Autoplay and Recommendation,"This work investigates the functioning of YouTube's recommendation system with focus on the autoplay function. The autoplay function was often referred to as ""radicalizer"" in the past, as it was considered to lead towards more extremist content. By an automated data collection through browser remote control, we simulate different usage scenarios (allowing and disallowing autoplay) with personalized accounts as well as with anonymous users. This leads to multiple recommendation paths, which are analyzed. The presented analyses suggest that while YouTube continues to rely on familiar mechanisms for capturing users' attention, ongoing public criticism with respect to the recommendation system has seemingly led to changes in YouTube's algorithm parameterization and to more cautious recommendations.","['Autoplay', 'Misinformation', 'Radicalization', 'Recommender system', 'YouTube']","['Business Models, Electric Mobility, Energy Informatics, Vehicle-To-Grid']",en

80054322,Accelerating the transformation? The impact of COVID-19 on the digital maturity of retail businesses,"The lock-down situation and subsequent restrictions as response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in revenue, liquidity bottlenecks and complicated customer management for German retailers. The crisis has put the organizations in a situation to rethink customer experience, business models, processes and IT. Thus, COVID-19 may be a tipping point for retailers to accelerate their digital transformation. For this study, a Digital Maturity Model is adjusted and transferred to construct a set of questions investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the digital maturity of retail businesses. In semi-structured and open-ended expert interviews, nine participants from retail businesses were asked to report the impact of COVID19 on the digital transformation in the different dimensions. The participating organizations changed the way of collaboration. New business models in E-Commerce were created. Further, less digitally mature organizations were found to pursue their digital transformation stronger.","['COVID-19', 'Digital Maturity Model', 'Digital Transformation', 'Expert Interviews']","['Data center scheduling, Genetic algorithm, Green IT, Sustainability']",en

80061562,Estimation of component reliability from superposed renewal processes by means of latent variables,"We present a new way to estimate the lifetime distribution of a reparable system consisted of similar (equal) components. We consider as a reparable system, a system where we can replace a failed component by a new one. Assuming that the lifetime distribution of all components (originals and replaced ones) are the same, the position of a single component can be represented as a renewal process. There is a considerable amount of works related to estimation methods for this kind of problem. However, the data has information only about the time of replacement. It was not recorded which component was replaced. That is, the replacement data are available in an aggregate form. Using both Bayesian and a maximum likelihood function approaches, we propose an estimation procedure for the lifetime distribution of components in a repairable system with aggregate data. Based on a latent variables method, our proposed method out-perform the commonly used estimators for this problem. The proposed procedure is generic and can be used with any lifetime probability model. Aside from point estimates, interval estimates are presented for both approaches. The performances of the proposed methods are illustrated through several simulated data, and their efficiency and applicability are shown based on the so-called cylinder problem. The computational implementation is available in the R packagesrplv.",,"['simulation', ' humanitarian logistics', ' literature review']",en
80061663,Digitalization’s Effects on Transport Planning and Specifically the Transport Coordinator’s Role,"Road freight transport has become a vital part of today’s life, and its importance will only rise in the future due to developments such as increasing e-commerce orders. Transport planning has become more complex and has to deal with many difficulties such as demand volatility, high customer expectations, or the consideration of legal regulations. The fast-changing environment makes dynamic and highly reactive planning, typically done by the transport coordinator, necessary. Incorporating technology is a promising way to deal with the complexity and dynamic environment of transport planning. Indeed, more data and computing power is available than ever before, and developments coined under “digitalization” are transforming transport planning. Before understanding the benefits digitalization can have, examining its influences on the industry, the roles participating in transport planning, and their relationship is necessary. Hence, this paper establishes an overview of roles associated with transport planning, identifies digitalization’s effects on transport planning and specifically the transport coordinator, and then provides an updated overview of roles considering these effects. The results show that new relations and roles are important for transport planning. The role of the transport coordinator itself is transformed mainly due to the emergence of platform-based business models.",,,en

The data-centric nature of smart city transformations highlights the essential role of urban data platform (UDP) to manage large and heterogeneous urban data sets and to facilitate interaction among data providers and users in a city ecosystem. To realize value creation through UDP, a comprehensive understanding of the key UDP dimensions and how they influence UDP adoption, use, and value creation are required. For this purpose, we first identify key UDP dimensions through a literature review. Second, by exploring and discussing their relationships with an expert panel, we develop a framework for understanding value creation through UDPs. By identifying key dimensions of UDP and their effects on value creation through UDP, the proposed framework provides a systematic and comprehensive approach for understanding UDP adoption, use, and value creation. Thereby, this study helps city policymakers and business developers in realizing value from UDPs in city ecosystems.",,"['Onlinezugangsgesetz', ' OZG-Umsetzung', ' E-Government', ' Öffentliche Dienstleistungen', ' Verwaltungsdigitalisierung']",en
80065755,Enabling Sustainable Public Transport in Smart Cities through Real-time Decision Support,"The growing consumption of fossil fuels and its negative environmental consequences have been a major concern during the last few decades. In line with that, public transport operators face global pressure to replace diesel buses by battery-electric buses (BEBs) in many countries. However, BEBs need to be recharged several times throughout the day to avoid running out of energy due to their limited driving range and slow charging rate. Accordingly, operating BEBs is substantially more sensitive to unanticipated delays and excess energy consumption, which raises serious challenges with respect to charging schedules. Moreover, BEBs are only a truly sustainable alternative if they are powered by renewable energy generators (REGs), which have intermittent and uncertain generation. Thus, we design and propose a real-time decision support system to overcome these uncertainties and maximize the utilization of REGs and minimize the impact on the grid while guaranteeing a feasible operation for the BEBs.","['Battery electric buses', 'Electrified transit bus networks', 'Real-time decision support system', 'Renewable energy', 'Sustainable public transport']","['Contextualized S&OP', ' Uncertain and complex environments']",en

We model multi-period planning of grid reinforcement on the basis of three investment strategies: a purely reactive strategy that disregards any information about the future, a proactive strategy that requires only a probability distribution of future distributed generation, and a hypothetical strategy assuming perfect information. Simulations show that 75% of the time the proactive strategy achieves equal or lower total reinforcement cost than the reactive strategy, which can be regarded as the industry standard. On average, it yields about 30% of theoretically possible savings. The results are robust to changing simulation parameters, including PV penetration levels.",,"['Smart City Operations', ' Crime Prediction', ' Prescriptive Policing']",en

Yet, their diffusion is slow and the general public is skeptical of their potential to replace conventional combustion vehicles (CVs). We investigate differences in driver behavior between the two types, showing how sharing economy approaches can help people overcome concerns related to electric mobility. We analyze a dataset of carsharing rentals of a provider who offers EVs and CVs under the same conditions, within the same city, comprising over 230,000 rentals of approximately 750 cars over a period of 3.5 months. Our preliminary results suggest that in fact, once people get acquainted with EVs - at least in an urban carsharing context - they use them in a very similar manner as they use CVs. This suggests that the sharing economy supports the adoption of electric mobility and fosters more sustainable transportation.","['Carsharing', 'Electric vehicles', 'Range anxiety', 'Sharing economy', 'Sustainable mobility']","['Big data, Points of interest, Social media, Spatio-temporal patterns, Uncertainty, Veracity']",en

We present a decision support system (DSS) based on integer programming that is able to determine cost-optimal grid reinforcements at the level of individual grid segments. The functionality of the DSS is demonstrated in a scenario analysis of a rising adoption of PV units relying on 1,000 simulation runs in a real-world grid. Based on the results, we provide guidelines for operative grid planning and illustrate how the system assists in the evaluation of reinforcement technologies as well as in long-term investment planning. Furthermore, thanks to segment-specific optimization, the DSS shows that at constant adoption levels, reinforcement cost can vary largely depending on the location of the PV units in the grid. Therefore, a high amount of uncertainty seems unavoidable in long-term prognoses on the effects of solar power on distribution grids.","['Decision support systems', 'Distributed power generation', 'Integer programming', 'Power system planning']","['Intermodal mobility, Location-based services, Mobility market platforms, Multimodal mobility, Spatial analytics, Sustainable mobility']",en

Business Intelligence methods have an enormous potential to support IT helpdesk employees by making implicit knowledge explicit, accelerating business processes throughout the entire company, and retaining the knowledge of experienced employees upon retirement. In this paper, we investigate these benefits by showing how analytics can automate the assignment of helpdesk tasks, enable early warning mechanisms for accumulated incidents, and enhance knowledge sharing among helpdesk users. For this purpose, we use a combination of topic modeling and predictive analytics, which is applied to an extensive dataset of support tickets from a global automotive supplier.

For this purpose, we analyze rental data of a major carsharing provider in the city of Amsterdam in combination with points of interest (POIs). Connecting POI data to carsharing trips and stratifying the data along 6-hour intervals allows us to illustrate the spatio-temporal dimensions of carsharing usage, i.e. how carsharing demand changes over time and how it shifts spatially within the provider's business area. We cluster the point data using kernel density estimation and apply a generalized linear model with Gamma distributed values on the sampled data. Our results indicate that, depending on the hour of the day, different POI categories have different, yet significant, impact on trip destinations. Our insights advance the understanding of when and for what purpose customers use carsharing, enabling providers to predict demand in existing and new business areas.","['Carsharing', 'Location-based services', 'Spatial analytics', 'Visualization']",,en

Through a demonstration case, we particularly focus on the relationship between public transportation and private sector carsharing services in the city of Berlin. We outline the methods employed by the prototype to investigate the spatial and temporal dimensions of carsharing usage and how they relate to public transport offers. Our results suggest that carsharing complements public transport in some ways - e.g. by linking parts of the city with an insufficient public transport connection but also low demand - while potentially cannibalizing customers from public transport in the city center due to the increased comfort. We conclude by discussing how stakeholders can transform these insights into actionable advice.","['Carsharing', 'Location-based services', 'Public transport', 'Spatial analytics', 'Urban mobility', 'Urban planning']","['Flash crash, Game theory, Hypergames, Impact of IT']",en

We develop a support system that enables user-based relocation of vehicles in free-floating carsharing models. In these businesses, customers can rent and leave cars anywhere within a predefined operational area. However, due to this flexibility, free-floating carsharing is prone to supply and demand imbalance. The support system detects imbalances by analyzing patterns in vehicle idle times. Alternative rental destinations are proposed to customers in exchange for a discount. Using data on 250,000 rentals in the city of Vancouver, we evaluate the relocation system through a simulation. The results show that our approach decreases the average vehicle idle time by up to 16 percent, suggesting a more balanced state of supply and demand. Employing the system results in a higher degree of vehicle utilization and leads to a substantial increase of profits for providers.","['Carsharing', 'Data analytics', 'Location-based services', 'Spatial analysis']","['Free-floating carsharing', ' Decision support', ' Data analytics', ' Spatial analysis']",en

Particularly through the flexibility of free-floating models, car sharing complements public transport since customers do not need to return cars to specific stations. We present a novel data analytics approach that provides decision support to car sharing operators - from local start-ups to global players - in maneuvering this constantly growing and changing market environment. Using a large set of rental data, as well as zero-inflated and geographically weighted regression models, we derive indicators for the attractiveness of certain areas based on points of interest in their vicinity. These indicators are valuable for a variety of operational and strategic decisions. As a demonstration project, we present a case study of Berlin, where the indicators are used to identify promising regions for business area expansion.","['Carsharing', 'Data analysis', 'Decision support', 'Location-based services', 'Visualization']","['Carsharing', ' Spatial analytics', ' Location-based services', ' Spatial decision support system']",en

Following a Design Science approach we develop an information system for microgrid operation at a U.S. army base. Microgrids enable an improved integration of distributed renewable energy sources and increase the robustness of the overall power grid. The microgrid in this study contains extensive photovoltaic generation, the energy demand of the base, as well as energy storage. The information system we design controls and optimizes microgrid operations under uncertainty, as well as physical and organizational constraints. Using real-world data to evaluate the system, we show that it substantially increases the amount of clean photovoltaic energy that can be generated while simultaneously decreasing energy costs of the base. Thereby, we are able to improve the ecological and economic efficiency of the microgrid.","['Case study/studies', 'Design science', 'Energy informatics', 'Environmental sustainability']",,en

Particularly for the urban metropolis of the 21st century electric vehicles embody a promise of decreased air pollution and increased quality of living. However, city planners need to muster enormous investments into urban charging infrastructure in advance. We develop a decision support system to help city planners use these funds more efficiently and place charging infrastructure where it is truly needed. We construct a regression model to determine factors that influence the utilization of charge points in Amsterdam, one of the most ""electrified"" cities in the world. We include data on more than 50,000 points of interest, for instance shopping malls and museums, as well as charging data from 273 charging points with 427 individual outlets in the city of Amsterdam.

The use of social networks to feed into crime platforms has been acknowledged to build a kind of a virtual neighborhood watch. Current attempts that tried to automatically connect news from social networks with crime platforms have concentrated on documentation of past events, but neglected the opportunity to use Twitter data as a decision support system to detect future crimes. In this work, we attempt to unleash the wisdom of crowds materialized in tweets from Twitter. This requires to look at Tweets that have been sent within a vicinity of each other. Based on the aggregated Tweets traffic we correlate them with crime types. Apparently, crimes such as disturbing the peace or homicide exhibit different Tweet patterns before the crime has been committed. We show that these tweet patterns can strengthen the explanation of criminal activity in urban areas. On top of that, we go beyond pure explanatory approaches and use predictive analytics to provide evidence that Twitter data can improve the prediction of crimes.","['Big Data', 'Decision Support', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Social Media']","['OR in energy', ' Microgrids', ' Economically-efficient operation', ' Demand charges', ' Uncertainty']",en

In this paper we explain flash crashes as the result of actions made by rational agents. We argue that information technology, which has long been associated with competitive advantages, may cause ambiguities with respect to the game form that give rise to a Hypergame. We employ Hypergame Theory to demonstrate that a market crash constitutes an equilibrium state if players misperceive the true game. Once the ambiguity is resolved, prices readjust to the appropriate level, creating the characteristic flash crash effect. We also discuss endogenous and exogenous mechanisms that may alleviate the threat of a flash crash and present possible options for future research. © 2014 IEEE.",,"['Carsharing', ' Station-based', ' Free-floating', ' Urban environment', ' Shared']",en

We introduce an IS artifact that uses historical data on energy consumption, energy generation, and mobility behavior to unleash synergies between residential photovoltaic panels and electric vehicles. Using real world data we show in simulations that our residential information system allows households to decrease annual net energy costs by up to 68 percent. This results in an earlier breakeven point of green technologies and clears a path towards a more sustainable society.

However, the ongoing shift in electrical energy generation raises the question whether a stable power grid is guaranteed if depending largely on suitable weather conditions. Certainly, the need for additional supply and demand reserves to compensate for fluctuations related to environmental conditions in the power grid will increase in the near future. In this paper we present a business model within the Energy Informatics Framework to use electric vehicles as distributed storage devices that draw or supply power to the grid during frequency fluctuations.

This opens up perspectives on new business models, including aggregators for electric vehicles that enter ancillary services energy markets. These intermediaries are of particular interest to the IS discipline, since their market position links research on decision support, electronic markets and energy informatics. In this paper we present a research agenda to analyze IS-supported business models that cover the entire value chain of such an intermediary. We argue that IS can enhance decision making in the auctions for ancillary energy by improving forecasts of maximum energy prices. Additionally, IS facilitates electronic auctions and scheduling mechanisms that enable the intermediary to aggregate numerous electric vehicles.","['Business models', 'Electric mobility', 'Electronic marketplace', 'Energy informatics']","['Supply Chain Management', ' Simulation', ' Optimization', ' Decision Support Systems', ' Blood Logistics']",en

80068288,Evaluating Scheduling Methods for Energy Cost Reduction in a Heterogeneous Data Center Environment,"Over the past two decades the rise of information technologies (IT) has enabled businesses to communicate, coordinate, and cooperate in unprecedented ways. However, this did not come without a price. Today, IT infrastructure accounts for a substantial fraction of the national energy consumption in most advanced countries. Subsequently, research turned to finding ways of making IT more sustainable and lessening the environmental impact of IT infrastructure. In our previous work we developed LINFIX, an innovative method for handling the scheduling problem in data centers, which substantially reduced the total energy consumption compared to commonly used practices. Due to the computational complexity of the scheduling problem, we were, however, unable to estimate the cost reduction of LINFIX compared to what is theoretically possible. In this work we employ a genetic algorithm to provide a benchmark to better assess the quality of the LINFIX solutions. While the genetic algorithm frequently finds better solutions, the additional average cost reduction when compared to LINFIX is less than 0.1 percent. Taking the computational speed into account, this confirms our hypothesis that LINFIX provides very energy efficient scheduling plans in short time.","['Data center scheduling', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Green IT', 'Sustainability']","['edge assembly crossover (EAX), evolutionary algorithms, evolutionary diversity optimisation (EDO), traveling salesperson problem (TSP)']",en
80068389,Autonomic Management of Software as a Service Systems with Multiple Quality of Service Classes,"In recent years the emergence of Software as a Service (SaaS) provision and cloud computing in general had a tremendous impact on corporate information technology. While the implementation and successful operation of powerful information systems continues to be a cornerstone of success in modern enterprises, the ability to acquire IT infrastructure, software, or platforms on a pay-as-you-go basis has opened a new avenue for optimizing operational costs and processes. In this context we target elastic SaaS systems with on-demand cloud resource provisioning and implement an autonomic management artifact. Our framework forecasts future user behavior based on historic data, analyzes the impact of different workload levels on system performance based on a non-linear performance model, analyzes the economic impact of different provisioning strategies, derives an optimal operation strategy, and automatically assigns requests from users belonging to different Quality of Service (QoS) classes to the appropriate server instances. More generally, our artifact optimizes IT system operation based on a holistic evaluation of key aspects of service operation (e.g., system usage patterns, system performance, Service Level Agreements). The evaluation of our prototype, based on a real production system workload trace, indicates a cost-of-operation reduction by up to 60 percent without compromising QoS requirements.","['Autonomic management', 'QoS classes', 'Service level agreements', 'Workload forecast']","['Mathematics of computing', ' Grah Theory', ' Supervised Learning', ' Computing methodologie']",en
80068589,Simulation-optimization Approaches for Blood Logistics in South Africa,"Blood logistics in South Africa is a challenging topic, during a crisis like the current COVID-19 pandemic, but also already in everyday life. Robust optimization approaches can help setting up and managing the blood supply chain including the decision about facility locations and transportation routes that are accessible, cost-efficient and can secure the demand in preferably all possible scenarios. In order to be solvable, these optimization approaches often need to make many assumptions for the practical problem. Then, it is good practice to analyze computed solutions by means of simulation, which models all relevant aspects of the practical setting. Current research is investigating so-called simulation-optimization approaches that integrate optimization approaches into a simulation in order to automate the process and improve the solution quality.

A systematic literature review is carried out in order to identify risk types and underlying factors considered in the context of risk monitoring. Furthermore, the monitored risk indicators and the data analytics methods applied in their generation, monitoring or prediction, as well as the underlying risk data are examined. The identified works focus mainly on micro risks, where supply and transport risks are the most prevalent. A variety of risk indicators is found to be used including both, qualitative and quantitative, which are often used jointly. Identified data sources range from operational databases to IoT and sensor networks. Moreover, first approaches utilizing predictive analytics methods to anticipate risks are identified.

As a result, the research in supply chain resilience has increased immensely over the last years. This growing research's particular focus is the kind of disruptions supply chains have to face and consequently what capabilities supply chains should inherit to be more resilient. This article focuses on the supply chain structure and investigates how resilience depends on it. Thus, a LR was conducted to identify the vulnerabilities the supply chain structure is exposed to and the strategies that exist to counteract these vulnerabilities and increase supply chain resilience. Findings show that vulnerabilities are manifold and that there is no strategy that in itself leads to supply chain resilience.

What was initially meant to strengthen public debates and democracy turned out to suffer from abusive use: Be it insulting journalists, posting misinformation, or pure hate. While many publishers and journalists are eager to create an engaged audience, user-generated content typically does not create direct revenues. However, keeping the abuse at bay is often obligatory from an ethical and legal perspective and can be costly. Germany has been highly affected by abuse in combination with strict regulation, leading to the shutdown of many comment sections. While reports in 2014 indicated closure rates of 50% and more, a structured overview of the situation in 2020/21 is missing. We conducted a structured assessment of 114 German newspaper websites containing all major outlets to account for this. Our analyses indicate that the deteriorating trend regarding the availability of comment sections slowed down in Germany. However, there are still open issues such as a high number of outlets using post-moderation and limited audience participation options.

In this paper, for the first time, we assess the potential of spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning methods for large-scale classification of land-use following tropical deforestation using dense satellite time series over six years on the pan-tropical scale (incl. Latin America, Africa, and Asia). Based on an extensive reference database of six forest to land-use conversion types, we find that the spatio-temporal models achieved a substantially higher F1-score accuracies than models that account only for spatial or temporal patterns. Although all models performed better when the scope of the problem was limited to a single continent, the spatial models were more competitive than the temporal ones in this setting. These results suggest that the spatial patterns of land-use within a continent share more commonalities than the temporal patterns and the spatial patterns across continents. This work explores the feasibility of extending and complementing previous efforts for characterizing follow-up land-use after deforestation at a small-scale via human visual interpretation of high resolution RGB imagery. It supports the usage of fast and automated large-scale land-use classification and showcases the value of deep learning methods combined with spatio-temporal satellite data to effectively address the complex tasks of identifying land-use following deforestation in a scalable and cost effective manner.","['Spatio-temporal', 'Deep learning methods', 'Large-scale land-use classification', 'Satellite imagery time series', 'Landsat imagery', 'Pan-tropical model', 'Continental models', 'Land-use following deforestation']","['video streaming', ' protocol', ' server', ' dash', ' cmaf']",en
80113223,Dataset Sensitive Autotuning of Multi-versioned Code Based on Monotonic Properties - Autotuning in Futhark,"Functional languages allow rewrite-rule systems that aggressively generate a multitude of semantically-equivalent but differently-optimized code versions. In the context of GPGPU execution, this paper addresses the important question of how to compose these code versions into a single program that (near-)optimally discriminates them across different datasets. Rather than aiming at a general autotuning framework reliant on stochastic search, we argue that in some cases, a more effective solution can be obtained by customizing the tuning strategy for the compiler transformation producing the code versions. We present a simple and highly-composable strategy which requires that the (dynamic) program property used to discriminate between code versions conforms with a certain monotonicity assumption. Assuming the monotonicity assumption holds, our strategy guarantees that if an optimal solution exists it will be found. If an optimal solution doesn’t exist, our strategy produces human tractable and deterministic results that provide insights into what went wrong and how it can be fixed. We apply our tuning strategy to the incremental-flattening transformation supported by the publicly-available Futhark compiler and compare with a previous black-box tuning solution that uses the popular OpenTuner library. We demonstrate the feasibility of our solution on a set of standard datasets of real-world applications and public benchmark suites, such as Rodinia and FinPar. We show that our approach shortens the tuning time by a factor of 6 × on average, and more importantly, in five out of eleven cases, it produces programs that are (as high as 10 × ) faster than the ones produced by the OpenTuner-based technique.","['Autotuning', 'Compilers', 'Flattening', 'GPGPU', 'Nested parallelism', 'Performance']","['Prescriptive Maintenance', ' Production Planning and Control', ' Reference Model', ' Prognostics and Health Management']",en
80135864,Peeking beyond peaks: Challenges and research potentials of continuous multimodal multi-objective optimization,"Multi-objective (MO) optimization, i.e., the simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives, is gaining more and more attention in various research areas, such as evolutionary computation, machine learning (e.g., (hyper-)parameter optimization), or logistics (e.g., vehicle routing). Many works in this domain mention the structural problem property of multimodality as a challenge from two classical perspectives: (1) finding all globally optimal solution sets, and (2) avoiding to get trapped in local optima. Interestingly, these streams seem to transfer many traditional concepts of single-objective (SO) optimization into claims, assumptions, or even terminology regarding the MO domain, but mostly neglect the understanding of the structural properties as well as the algorithmic search behavior on a problem&rsquo;s landscape. However, some recent works counteract this trend, by investigating the fundamentals and characteristics of MO problems using new visualization techniques and gaining surprising insights. Using these visual insights, this work proposes a step towards a unified terminology to capture multimodality and locality in a broader way than it is usually done. This enables us to investigate current research activities in multimodal continuous MO optimization and to highlight new implications and promising research directions for the design of benchmark suites, the discovery of MO landscape features, the development of new MO (or even SO) optimization algorithms, and performance indicators.

80162751,Integrating Sales and Operations Planning with Supply Chain Risk Management,"<p>To deal with complex and uncertain environments, academics and practitioners suggest the integration of Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) with Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). However, literature lacks in providing guidance on how such an integration can be operationalized and how the S&OP process needs to be adjusted accordingly. In this paper, it is investigated how four common SCRM activities (risk identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring) can be integrated into the S&OP process. The research embraces the conduction of both a literature review and expert interviews. As a result, four propositions are offered on how the integration can be realized.<br /></p>",Contextualized S&OP; Uncertain and complex environments,"['Hyperparameter Optimization', '  Exploratory Landscape Analysis', ' Machine Learning', ' Black-Box Optimization', ' Benchmarking']",en
80181181,Prescriptive Analytics in Urban Policing Operations,"Problem definition: We consider the case of prescriptive policing, that is, the data-driven assignment of police cars to different areas of a city. We analyze key problems with respect to prediction, optimization, and evaluation as well as trade-offs between different quality measures and crime types. Academic/practical relevance: Data-driven prescriptive analytics is gaining substantial attention in operations management research, and effective policing is at the core of the operations of almost every city in the world. Given the vast amounts of data increasingly collected within smart city initiatives and the growing safety challenges faced by urban centers worldwide, our work provides novel insights on the development and evaluation of prescriptive analytics applications in an urban context. Methodology: We conduct a computational study using crime and auxiliary data on the city of San Francisco. We analyze both strong and weak prediction methods along with two optimization formulations representing the deterrence and response time impact of police vehicle allocations. We analyze trade-offs between these effects and between different crime types. Results: We find that even weaker prediction methods can produce Pareto-efficient outcomes with respect to deterrence and response time. We identify three different archetypes of combinations of prediction methods and optimization objectives that constitute the Pareto frontier among the configurations we analyze. Furthermore, optimizing for multiple crime types biases allocations in a way that generally decreases single-type performance along one outcome metric but can improve it along the other. Managerial implications: Although optimization integrating all relevant crime types is theoretically possible, it is practically challenging because each crime type requires a collectively consistent weight. We present a framework combining prediction and optimization for a subset of key crime types with exploring the impact on the remaining types to support implementation of operations-focused smart city solutions in practice.",Smart City Operations; Crime Prediction; Prescriptive Policing,"['Abusive language', ' Comment moderation', ' Model store']",en

80181378,Taming Uncertainty in Big Data,"While the classic definition of Big Data included the dimensions volume, velocity, and variety, a fourth dimension, veracity, has recently come to the attention of researchers and practitioners. The increasing amount of user-generated data associated with the rise of social media emphasizes the need for methods to deal with the uncertainty inherent to these data sources. In this paper we address one aspect of uncertainty by developing a new methodology to establish the reliability of user-generated data based upon causal links with recurring patterns. We associate a large data set of geo-tagged Twitter messages in San Francisco with points of interest, such as bars, restaurants, or museums, within the city. This model is validated by causal relationships between a point of interest and the amount of messages in its vicinity. We subsequently analyze the behavior of these messages over time using a jackknifing procedure to identify categories of points of interest that exhibit consistent patterns over time. Ultimately, we condense this analysis into an indicator that gives evidence on the certainty of a data set based on these causal relationships and recurring patterns in temporal and spatial dimensions.","['Big data', 'Points of interest', 'Social media', 'Spatio-temporal patterns', 'Uncertainty', 'Veracity']","['decision making', ' characteristics', ' artificial intelligence', ' prototype']",en

This development potentially contributes to more sustainable urban mobility, but also creates complexity for the customer. To simplify customer offerings, so-called multimodal mobility platforms (MMPs) have emerged, bundling the different mobility services to find the best route for the user. These platforms also function as marketplaces where customers can purchase mobility services from different suppliers. As part of this process, data is being generated, which can be utilized to yield valuable insights for suppliers and platform operators. In this paper, we describe the business model of MMPs and provide an overview of currently active solutions. Subsequently we present specific use cases, showing how suppliers can leverage the analytics possibilities of MMPs and how this affects the business model.","['Intermodal mobility', 'Location-based services', 'Mobility market platforms', 'Multimodal mobility', 'Spatial analytics', 'Sustainable mobility']","['Social Media', ' Automation', ' Bots', ' Artificial Intelligence', ' Content Generation']",en

In this paper, we explain flash crashes as the result of actions made by rational agents. We argue that the advancement of information technology (IT), which has long been associated with competitive advantages, may cause ambiguities with respect to the game form that give rise to a hypergame. We employ hypergame theory to demonstrate that a market crash constitutes an equilibrium state if players misperceive the true game. Once the ambiguity is resolved, prices readjust to the appropriate level, creating the characteristic flash-crash effect. By analyzing the interaction with herd behavior, we find that flash crashes may be an unavoidable systemic problem of modern financial markets.","['Flash crash', 'Game theory', 'Hypergames', 'Impact of IT']","['Process Querying', ' Process Analysis', ' Query Language', ' Conceptual Modeling']",en
80182035,Design of automated negotiation mechanisms for decentralized heterogeneous machine scheduling,"We consider a hard decentralized scheduling problem with heterogeneous machines and competing job sets that belong to different self-interested stakeholders (agents). The determination of a beneficial solution, i.e., a respective contract in terms of a common schedule, is particularly difficult due to information asymmetry and self-interested behavior of the involved agents. The agents intend to minimize their individual costs that consist of tardiness cost and their share of the machine operating cost. The aim of this study is to find socially beneficial outcomes by means of negotiation mechanisms that comply with decentralized information and conflicting interests. For this purpose, we present an automated negotiation protocol, which is inspired by metaheuristics, along with a set of optional building blocks. In the protocol, new solutions are iteratively generated, as mutations of a single provisional contract, and proposed to the agents, while feasible rules with quotas restrict the acceptance decisions of the agents. The computational experiments show that the protocol&mdash;without central information and subject to strategic behavior&mdash;can achieve high quality solutions which are very close to results from centralized multi-criteria procedures. Particular building block configurations yield improved outcomes. Concluding, the considered scheduling problem enhances standard scheduling models by incorporating multiple stakeholders, nonlinear cost functions, and machine operating cost, whereas the presented negotiation approach contributes to the methodology and practice of collaborative decision making.",Group decisions and negotiations; Scheduling; Negotiation protocol; Mechanism design; Complex contracts,"['Incremental Learning', ' Text Classification', ' Comment Moderation Systems']",en

Especially free-floating carsharing, which allows customers to leave their car anywhere within the operator׳s business area, provides users with flexibility, and complements public transportation. We present a novel method that provides strategic and operational decision support to companies maneuvering this competitive and constantly changing market environment. Using an extensive set of customer data in a zero-inflated regression model, we explain spatial variation in carsharing activity through the proximity of particular points of interests, such as movie theaters and airports. As an application case, as well as a validation of the model, we use the resulting indicators to predict the number of rentals before an expansion of the business area and compare it to the actual demand post-expansion. We find that our approach correctly identifies areas with a high carsharing activity and can be easily adapted to other cities.",Free-floating carsharing; Decision support; Data analytics; Spatial analysis,"['Community Management', ' Machine Learning', ' Content Moderation', ' Comment Moderation Support System', ' Digital Work']",en
80182251,Evaluating a business model for vehicle-grid integration: Evidence from Germany,"Intelligently managing the charging processes of electric vehicles is generally considered to be a promising method of supporting the integration of volatile renewable energy sources into the power grid. We analyze this concept from an economic perspective by developing and evaluating a business model for vehicle-grid integration. Specifically, we investigate the case of parking garage operators using the electric vehicles located at their facilities to provide reserve energy for frequency regulation. We evaluate revenues and cost structures using extensive real-world data sets on the German market for frequency regulation, on battery states of charge at different times of day, and on occupancy rates of parking facilities. We find that possible revenues, given current market conditions, are inferior to investment costs for charging and IT infrastructure. Even if the operator installs these features to enable customers to charge their vehicles for a fee, it would be more profitable to focus on this service and charge batteries immediately when the vehicles enter the garage instead of delaying charging for frequency regulation. Overall, our results illustrate that studies on the relationship between electric vehicles and the integration of renewable energy sources require a closer look at the associated business models to derive robust economic and policy implications.",Electric mobility; Business model; Vehicle-grid integration; Vehicle-to-grid; Renewable energy integration,"['alternative news media', ' alternative counter-news', ' authoritarianism', ' conspiracy mentality', ' coronavirus', ' COVID-19', ' differential susceptibility to media effects', ' fake news', ' trust']",en

For this purpose, we analyze rental data of a major carsharing provider in the city of Amsterdam in combination with points of interest (POIs). The spatio-temporal demand variations are used to develop pricing zones for existing business areas. We then apply the influence of POIs derived from carsharing usage in Amsterdam in order to predict carsharing demand in the city of Berlin. The results indicate that predicted and actual usage patterns are very similar. Hence, our approach can be used to define new business areas when expanding to new cities to include high demand areas and exclude low demand areas, thereby reducing the risk of supply-demand imbalance.",Carsharing; Spatial analytics; Location-based services; Spatial decision support system,"['Digital transformation', ' supply chain management', ' maturity models', ' survey']",en
80182466,Modeling interferences in information systems design for cyberphysical systems: Insights from a smart grid application,"In this paper, we analyze possible interferences that occur when developing information systems for cyberphysical systems–hybrids containing legacy technical components and added IT modules. In particular, the enhancement of electricity systems through IT components, resulting in smart grid and smart home solutions, is experiencing increasing adoption rates in advanced and developing countries alike. Due to the substantial interdependence with and reliance on often decades-old legacy infrastructure, these cyberphysical systems present particular opportunities and challenges for the associated information systems. We propose that one channel through which information systems improve cyberphysical systems is by enhancing the components of the legacy system with new features. Introducing the Design–Interference Model, we conceptualize IS design for cyberphysical systems and outline possible obstacles and interferences associated with it. Using a simulation experiment for a smart grid application as a showcase, we derive insights into how to address these challenges. We condense these results into actionable advice that, first, seeks to validate existing guidelines for design-oriented research, second, extends and focuses them on cyberphysical system applications and, third, provides guidance to researchers and practitioners in this increasingly relevant area of information system development.","['cyberphysical Systems', 'Design science', 'design-interference model', 'smart grid', 'sustainability']","['Software Engineering', ' Digital Transformation', ' Idea Management', ' Small and Medium-sized Enterprise', ' Collaboration']",en

Historical amenity data from OpenStreetMap is used to quantify change in shop and sustenance amenity counts. We apply an instrumental variable framework to investigate a causal relationship and to account for endogeneity in the model. Measures of cycling infrastructure serve as instruments. The impact is evaluated on the level of 4835 Lower Super Output Areas in Greater London. Our results indicate that an increase in cycling trips significantly contributes to the emergence of new local shops and businesses. Limitations regarding data quality, zero-inflation and residual spatial autocorrelation are discussed. While our findings correspond to previous investigations stating positive economic effects of cycling, we advance research in the field by providing a new dataset of unprecedented high granularity and size. Furthermore, this is the first study in cycling research looking at business amenities as a measure of economic activity. The insights from our analysis can enhance understandings of how cycling affects the development of local urban economies and may thus be used to assess and evaluate transport policies and investments.

In this study, we optimize the opportunity fast-charging schedule of transit BEB networks in order to minimize the charging costs and the impact on the grid. Two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations that use different discretization approaches are developed and compared. Discrete-Time Optimization (DTO) resembles a time-expanded network that discretizes the time and decisions to equal discrete slots. Discrete-Event Optimization (DEO) discretizes the time and decisions into nonuniform slots based on arrival and departure events in the network. In addition to the DEO&rsquo;s higher practicability, the comparative computational study carried out on the transit-bus network in the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands, shows that the DEO is superior to the DTO in terms of computational performance. To show the potential benefits of the optimal schedule, it is compared with two reference common-sense greedy strategies: First-in-First-Served and Lowest-Charge-Highest-Priority.","['Charging schedule', 'Mixed integer linear programming', 'Transit electric bus networks']","['Infrastructure', ' infrastructuring', ' Heidegger', ' hermeneutic circle', ' reflective diary', ' empirical case']",en
80182783,Strategies for microgrid operation under real-world conditions,"Microgrids are an increasingly relevant technology for integrating renewable energy sources into electricity systems. Based on a microgrid implementation in California, we investigate microgrid operation under real-world conditions. These conditions have not yet been considered in combination and encompass energy charges, demand charges, export limits, as well as uncertainty about future electricity demand and generation in the microgrid. Under these conditions, we evaluate the performance of two frequently applied groups of strategies for microgrid operation. The first group is composed of proactive strategies that optimize decisions based on forecasts of future electricity generation and demand. The second group includes reactive strategies that make operational decisions based exclusively on the current state of the microgrid. We evaluate the performance of the strategies under varying operational parameters, forecast accuracies, and microgrid configurations&mdash;well beyond our Californian showcase. Our results confirm the expectation that proactive strategies outperform reactive ones in the majority of settings. Yet, reactive strategies can perform better under short control intervals or under moderate prediction errors of PV generation or demand. Furthermore, the interplay between real-world conditions and operational strategies reveals several additional insights for research on microgrid operation. First, we find that demand charges and export limits decisively affect microgrid performance. Second, the impact of forecast errors is highly non-linear and non-monotonous. Third, escalating negative interactions between forecast errors and demand charges make proactive strategies benefit from longer control intervals. This result is contrary to existing best practice, which promotes short control intervals to minimize the impact of uncertainty.",OR in energy; Microgrids; Economically-efficient operation; Demand charges; Uncertainty,"['smart city', ' phishing', ' spear phishing', ' persuasion techniques', ' human error', ' cybersecurity', ' experiment']",en

There is a clear need for carsharing operators to understand their users and how they use different transportation modes to intensify the development of carsharing and its positive impacts on the environment and urban cohabitation. We foster this understanding by analyzing usage data of carsharing in a medium-sized German city. We compare user groups based on individual characteristics and their carsharing usage behavior. We focus on a station-based two-way carsharing scheme and its relation to free-floating carsharing. Based on different clustering and segmentation approaches, we defined 20 particularly interesting user groups among the carsharing users and analyzed noticeable usage patterns. Additionally, we examined these partially overlapping user groups in the spatial dimension. With these results, we support research and operators in understanding carsharing customers and assessing users&rsquo; individual behavior.",Carsharing; Station-based; Free-floating; Urban environment; Shared,"['digital-ready legislation', ' design requirements', ' digitization check', ' e-Government', ' public sector digitization']",en
80182998,Temporal city-scale matching of solar photovoltaic generation and electric vehicle charging,"The number of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar photovoltaic panels (PVs) are rapidly increasing in many power grids. An important emerging challenge is managing their less desirable consequences (e.g. grid instability and peak load), particularly in urban environments. We present a solution that matches the temporal nature of PV generation and EV charging. This solution is a simple coordination strategy for EV charging which minimally affects EV availability for drivers while maximizing the PV electricity generation absorbed by EV batteries. The strategy is benchmarked with high-resolution data from a medium-sized European city. We find that this coordination provides large benefits compared to commonly-observed uncoordinated charging patterns across seasons and PV and EV integration levels. With charging coordination, almost 71%&ndash;92% of the EV charging load can be provided by solar panels in the summer. However, winter&rsquo;s lower solar irradiance results in a larger range of possibilities (13%&ndash;76%), with the exact value depending on the combination of PV and EV integration level. The gains compared to uncoordinated charging are generally highest in winter and similarly vary based on PV and EV integration levels (from 5 to 63 percentage points). Additionally, these benefits do not appear to come at a significant cost to EV availability for drivers.",Renewable energy; Electric vehicles; Solar panels,"['supply chain uncertainty', ' context-specific S&OP', ' survey research']",en

80195835,Do Additional Optima Speed Up Evolutionary Algorithms?,"Most runtime analyses of randomised search heuristics focus on the expected number of function evaluations to find a unique global optimum. We ask a fundamental question: if additional search points are declared optimal, or declared as desirable target points, do these additional optima speed up evolutionary algorithms? More formally, we analyse the expected hitting time of a target set OPT ∪ S where S is a set of non-optimal search points and OPT is the set of optima and compare it to the expected hitting time of OPT. We show that the answer to our question depends on the number and placement of search points in S. For all black-box algorithms and all fitness functions we show that, if additional optima are placed randomly, even an exponential number of optima has a negligible effect on the expected optimisation time. Considering Hamming balls around all global optima gives an easier target for some algorithms and functions and can shift the phase transition with respect to offspring population sizes in the (1,λ) EA on One-Max. Finally, on functions where search trajectories typically join in a single search point, turning one search point into an optimum drastically reduces the expected optimisation time.","['evolutionary algorithms', 'pseudo-boolean functions', 'runtime analysis', 'theory']","['Performance Measurement Systems', ' Supply Chain', ' Data Analytics']",en
80195933,Computing Diverse Sets of High Quality TSP Tours by EAX-Based Evolutionary Diversity Optimisation,"Evolutionary algorithms based on edge assembly crossover (EAX) constitute some of the best performing incomplete solvers for the well-known traveling salesperson problem (TSP). Often, it is desirable to compute not just a single solution for a given problem, but a diverse set of high quality solutions from which a decision maker can choose one for implementation. Currently, there are only a few approaches for computing a diverse solution set for the TSP. Furthermore, almost all of them assume that the optimal solution is known. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary diversity optimisation (EDO) approaches for the TSP that find a diverse set of tours when the optimal tour is known or unknown. We show how to adopt EAX to not only find a high-quality solution but also to maximise the diversity of the population. The resulting EAX-based EDO approach, termed EAX-EDO is capable of obtaining diverse high-quality tours when the optimal solution for the TSP is known or unknown. A comparison to existing approaches shows that they are clearly outperformed by EAX-EDO.","['edge assembly crossover (EAX)', 'evolutionary algorithms', 'evolutionary diversity optimisation (EDO)', 'traveling salesperson problem (TSP)']","['voice assistant', ' voice commerce', ' e-commerce', ' adoption', ' mixed-methods.']",en
80196031,On the Potential of Normalized TSP Features for Automated Algorithm Selection,"<p>Classic automated algorithm selection (AS) for (combinatorial) optimization problems heavily relies on so-called instance features, i.e., numerical characteristics of the problem at hand ideally extracted with computationally low-demanding routines. For the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) a plethora of features have been suggested. Most of these features are, if at all, only normalized imprecisely raising the issue of feature values being strongly affected by the instance size. Such artifacts may have detrimental effects on algorithm selection models. We propose a normalization for two feature groups which stood out in multiple AS studies on the TSP: (a) features based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) and (b) a <i>k</i>-nearest neighbor graph (NNG) transformation of the input instance. To this end we theoretically derive minimum and maximum values for properties of MSTs and <i>k</i>-NNGs of Euclidean graphs. We analyze the differences in feature space between normalized versions of these features and their unnormalized counterparts. Our empirical investigations on various TSP benchmark sets point out that the feature scaling succeeds in eliminating the effect of the instance size. Eventually, a proof-of-concept AS-study shows promising results: models trained with normalized features tend to outperform those trained with the respective vanilla features.<br /></p>",Mathematics of computing; Grah Theory; Supervised Learning; Computing methodologie,"['Künstliche Intelligenz', ' Versicherungswirtschaft', ' Bias']",en
80196341,Free Objects in Constraint-logic Object-oriented Programming,"Constraint-logic object-oriented programming facilitates the integrated development of business software that occasionally solves constraint-logic problems or makes other use of structured search. So far, work in constraint-logic object-oriented programming has been limited to considering constraints that only involve logic variables of primitive types; in particular, boolean, integer, and floating-point numbers. However, the availability of object-oriented features calls for the option to use logic variables in lieu of objects as well. Therefore, support for reference-type logic variables (or free objects) is required. With the work at hand, we add support for free objects to a Java-based constraint-logic object-oriented language, Muli. Allowing free objects in statements and expressions results in novel interactions with objects at run time, for instance, non-deterministic execution of polymorphic method invocations (taking arbitrary class hierarchies into account) and non-deterministic type operations. At run time, this is supported by a dynamic type constraint that restricts the possible types of a free object at non-deterministic choices.",constraint-logic object-oriented programming; free objects; Muli; Java; constraint solving,"['Cloud mindset', ' Creativity', ' Cloud-bases enterprise systems', ' SaaS', ' Design thinking']",en

Legally required to prevent the dissemination of hate and threats, manual moderation is an increasingly daunting task for journalists and part-time community managers. Consequently, many comment sections are closed for economic reasons world-wide. While there is ongoing academic and practice research on machine learning (ML) systems to detect abusiveness or hate, the focus typically remains on this limited technical task. Integrations into systems for practical community management are still rare. Based on eleven semi-structured interviews with experts of four German newspapers of varying size (incl. an observation of their working patterns), complemented by insights from workshops on community management, we could identify five major functional requirements for creating such integrated systems. This range goes from the need for increased transparency and controllability to better support for team-based community management.

80207102,Methodological and Practical Challenges of Interdisciplinary Trust Research,"Trust plays a pivotal role in many different contexts and thus has been investigated by researchers in a variety of disciplines. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive overview of methodological approaches to investigating trust and its antecedents. We explain how quantitative methods may be used to measure expectations about a trustee or instances of communication about trust efficiently, and we explain how using qualitative measures may be beneficial to researching trust in less explored contexts and for further theory development. We further point out that mixed methods research (uniting both quantitative and qualitative approaches) may be able to grasp the full complexity of trust. Finally, we introduce how agent-based modeling may be used to simulate and predict complex trust relationships on different levels of analysis. We elaborate on challenges and advantages of all these different methodological approaches to researching trust and conclude with recommendations to guide trust researchers in their planning of future investigations on both situational trust and long-term developments of trust in different contexts, and we emphasize why we believe that such undertakings will benefit from interdisciplinary approaches.",trust; measurement of trust; quantitative research; qualitative research; mixed methods research; agent-based modeling,"['Disinformation', '  Campaigns', ' Intervention Strategies', ' Prebunking', ' Agent-Based Modelling']",en

Public administrations are using information and communication technologies for decades now; however, public e-services are still not widely used by the intended users. Repeatedly, scholars highlight the importance of trust for the successful adoption of public e-services and much research has empirically investigated the role of trust for public e-service adoption. In face of the substantial amount of research, this chapter summarises the current debates surrounding this topic and provides empirical insights on the role of trust for public e-service use in Germany. The insights of both empirical studies, i.e. the literature review and the interviews, result in a generalised model of citizens' trust in the context of e-government.",trust; electronic government; public services; public service delivery; e-services; e-government,"['Digitale Gesetzgebung', ' Digicheck', ' Digitalcheck', ' eGovernment', ' Gesetzesvorbereitung']",en

A Mixed-Method Study Using the Case of BPM,"To meet the rising demand for e-government, the so-called e-competences are a crucial building block, enabling public officials to push digitalization efforts forward. One exemplary, highly relevant competence is BPM. It is yet unclear to which degree such competences are already available and which adjustments to the educational settings have to be implemented to ensure their proper distribution. To gain insights into this highly relevant topic, we conducted a large-scale survey with 713 respondents, complemented by five in-depth interviews with public officials. In line with previous research, we found that e-competences, especially in BPM, are still scarce despite the widely acknowledged need. Based on our data sample, both traditional offline and online teaching provide many beneficial aspects. However, each mode alone does not fully cater to the needs outlined by our respondents. Hence, we argue for putting more focus on the establishment of blended learning scenarios.","['BPM competence', 'Digital competences', 'Digital government', 'Vocational training']","['Classification', ' Learning from data streams', ' Imbalanced data', ' Over-sampling', ' Clustering']",en

Experiments","Assessing the outcomes of chemical reactions in a quantitative fashion has been a cornerstone across all synthetic disciplines. Classically approached through empirical optimization, data-driven modelling bears an enormous potential to streamline this process. However, such predictive models require significant quantities of high-quality data, the availability of which is limited: Main reasons for this include experimental errors and, importantly, human biases regarding experiment selection and result reporting. In a series of case studies, we investigate the impact of these biases for drawing general conclusions from chemical reaction data, revealing the utmost importance of “negative” examples. Eventually, case studies into data expansion approaches showcase directions to circumvent these limitations—and demonstrate perspectives towards a long-term data quality enhancement in chemistry.","['Cross-Coupling', 'Data Bias', 'Machine Learning', 'Reaction Data', 'Yield Prediction']","['feature engineering', ' automatic feature engineering', ' self-organizing maps', ' machine learning']",

Nevertheless, research in this area is hampered by strict data sharing regulations imposed by the platforms, resulting in a lack of benchmark data. Previous work focused on circumventing these rules by either pseudonymizing the data or sharing fragments. In this work, we will address the benchmarking crisis by presenting a methodology that can be used to create artificial campaigns out of original campaign building blocks. We conduct a proof-of-concept study using the freely available generative language model \texttt{GPT-Neo} in this context and demonstrate that the campaign patterns can flexibly be adapted to an underlying social media stream and evade state-of-the-art campaign detection approaches based on stream clustering. Thus, we not only provide a framework for artificial benchmark generation but also demonstrate the possible adversarial nature of such benchmarks for challenging and advancing current campaign detection methods.<br /></p>",Social Media; Campaign; Benchmarking; Augmentation,"['database', ' query formulation', ' query reverse engineering', ' data purchase', ' data marketplace', ' machine learning', ' non-technical users']",en
81828729,Parallelization of Swarm Intelligence Algorithms,"Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms are frequently applied to tackle complex optimization problems. SI is especially used when good solutions are requested for NP hard problems within a reasonable response time. And when such problems possess a very high dimensionality, a dynamic nature, or present intrinsic complex intertwined independent variables, computational costs for SI algorithms may still be too high. Therefore, new approaches and hardware support are needed to speed up processing. Nowadays, with the popularization of GPU and multi-core processing, parallel versions of SI algorithms can provide the required performance on those though problems. This paper aims to describe the state of the art of such approaches, to summarize the key points addressed, and also to identify the research gaps that could be addressed better. The scope of this review considers recent papers mainly focusing on parallel implementations of the most frequently used SI algorithms. The use of nested parallelism is of particular interest, since one level of parallelism is often not sufficient to exploit the computational power of contemporary parallel hardware.

Like passwords, private keys are required to remain confidential to prevent unauthorized access to resources. These secrets might become subject to theft or publicly exposed unintentionally by the key’s owner. In such cases, the keys are deemed compromised and need to be revoked and abandoned instantaneously. Unfortunately, it is rarely possible for users to know whether their secret keys have been publicly exposed. </p><p>Closing this gap, we introduce a private key leakage checker titled KeyPwned crawling the Internet for exposed authentication keys. We present a continuously updated database of leaked keys’ fingerprints discovered on websites or in source code repositories. For community-driven enhancement, we allow suggestions of URLs to scan for additional leaked keys, following our standardized process. We furthermore offer users a registration with their public keys to be notified if we detect leakage of their corresponding private key. KeyPwned is designed to run as a service following common software design standards, empowering users to verify their keys’ confidentiality and take action if a private key has been exposed.<br /></p>",Public Key Authentication; Leakage Detection; Security Services,"['Multi-objective optimization', ' Multimodality', ' Performance metric', ' Benchmarking', ' Continuous optimization', ' Anytime behavior']",en

In the last years, prescriptive maintenance (PxM) emerged as a strategy to increase overall production performance, but an alignment of the PPC process with PxM has not been examined yet. To tackle this problem, a PxM-aligned PPC process is designed and evaluated in this study using a reference model development methodology, including a narrative literature review, a multivocal literature review, and eight expert interviews. The reference model shows where process elements benefit from PxM alignment, how alignment can be achieved from a process and output, data, function, and organization view, and where fits and gaps between theory and practice are.<br /></p>",Prescriptive Maintenance; Production Planning and Control; Reference Model; Prognostics and Health Management,"['remote sensing', ' machine learning']",en
82031335,Aligning the Production Planning and Control Process with Prognostics and Health Management,"<p>Production planning and control (PPC) is the heart of any manufacturing 
company and entails tasks such as resource planning, sequencing, or 
capacity control. While an increasing complexity within production makes
 it difficult to determine the best production plan, the advances in PHM
 and the emergence of predictive maintenance also offer new 
opportunities to optimize PPC. While there is much research on PHM and 
PPC, little has been done to align both disciplines. Through 
post-prognostics decision-making, different PPC decisions, such as 
continuing the production, shutting down a machine, or reducing its 
workload, can be elevated by a remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. 
However, it is unclear how exactly this prognostics information can be 
exploited and how processes, organization, and technology must be 
aligned to attain a more efficient and flexible production. Further, PHM
 has long been implemented beyond research, but it is unknown whether 
and how practitioners intertwine it with their PPC. This work aims to 
analyze how processual, organizational, and technological changes 
through PHM can lead to advanced PPC. This goal is attained by means of a
 multivocal literature review (MLR) in which scientific PPC and PHM 
literature and standards are analyzed, and an aligned PPC process 
proposed. The findings are juxtaposed with grey literature, revealing 
fits and gaps between research and practice, and a research agenda is

While numerous methods and algorithms for HPO have been proposed over the last years, little progress has been made in illuminating and examining the actual structure of these black-box optimization problems. Exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) subsumes a set of techniques that can be used to gain knowledge about properties of unknown optimization problems. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of five different black-box optimizers on 30 HPO problems, which consist of two-, three- and five-dimensional continuous search spaces of the XGBoost learner trained on 10 different data sets. This is contrasted with the performance of the same optimizers evaluated on 360 problem instances from the black-box optimization benchmark (BBOB). We then compute ELA features on the HPO and BBOB problems and examine similarities and differences. A cluster analysis of the HPO and BBOB problems in ELA feature space allows us to identify how the HPO problems compare to the BBOB problems on a structural meta-level. We identify a subset of BBOB problems that are close to the HPO problems in ELA feature space and show that optimizer performance is comparably similar on these two sets of benchmark problems. We highlight open challenges of ELA for HPO and discuss potential directions of future research and applications.</p>",Hyperparameter Optimization;  Exploratory Landscape Analysis; Machine Learning; Black-Box Optimization; Benchmarking,"['risk', ' trust', ' e-government', ' literature review', ' information systems']",en
82103199,Elicitation of Requirements for a NLP-Model Store for Abusive Language Detection,"While in social media users most commonly interact with each other without a guiding entity, the discussion space of newspaper platforms is moderated by community managers, who invest considerable amounts of time and effort in keeping comment sections clean. To reduce this effort and allow community managers again to more freely interact with their users, automated comment moderation systems (ACMS) be be utilized. However, most newspapers do not have the expertise to create, update, and maintain machine learning (ML)-models. Thus, they are forced to rely on proprietary off-the-shelf solutions. However, if they want to keep their sovereignty over their data and systems, they would need access to models which could be integrated within their current moderation or content management systems. One option could be a platform for newspapers and data scientists where the data scientists could sell their pre-trained models and where newspapers could hire data scientists to create tailor-made models for them. In order to identify the requirements, community managers have for such systems, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with community managers of newspapers of varying size (from local to national). Furthermore, the information was enriched by the participation in multiple workshops on content moderation. We were able to elicit five major technical requirements necessary to create the described design artifact.",Abusive language; Comment moderation; Model store,"['Digital transformation', ' supply chain management', ' maturity models', ' survey']",en
82103647,No Time like the Present: Effects of Language Change on Automated Comment Moderation,"<p>
     The spread of online hate has become a significant problem for 
newspapers that host comment sections. As a result, there is growing 
interest in using machine learning and natural language processing for 
(semi-) automated abusive language detection to avoid manual comment 
moderation costs or having to shut down comment sections altogether. 
However, much of the past work on abusive language detection assumes 
that classifiers operate in a static language environment, despite 
language and news being in a state of constant flux. In this paper, we 
show using a new German newspaper comments dataset that the classifiers 
trained with naive ML techniques like a random-test train split will 
underperform on future data, and that a time stratified evaluation split
 is more appropriate. We also show that classifier performance rapidly 
degrades when evaluated on data from a different period than the 
training data. Our findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the
 temporal dynamics of language when developing an abusive language 
detection system or risk deploying a model that will quickly become 
defunct.   </p>

82137025,Measuring the Influence of Characteristics on Decision-Making Scenarios: A Prototype,"<p>Nowadays, the world is digitalized and data-driven, transforming decision-making as information is available to essentially any person at practically any time. A naive approach would at first propose that with a greater amount of information, i.e., a greater amount of data, a more educated choice can be reached. Rather, many decision scenarios reach a point today where individuals can no longer acquire and comprehend the vast volume of data on their own. As a corollary, people seek the assistance of algorithms and machines to make reasoned and informed decisions when confronted with difficult issues or problems. However, current research lacks a perspective that can recognize and empirically explore the complex multidimensional nature of the relationships between the defining characteristics of such scenarios. We bridge this void by investigating how the influence of these relationships affects human decision making and perception of an artificial intelligence/system. Specifically, we propose a web-based prototype to simulate decision-making scenarios in which it is possible to change certain characteristics (e.g., transparency, control) and analyze how the change affects the person’s decisions and perceptions (e.g., trust) toward the system.<br /></p>",decision making; characteristics; artificial intelligence; prototype,"['Digital work', ' Hidden work', ' Configuration', ' Liminal innovation', ' Robotic surgery', ' Zoom teaching']",en

Alternative news media have been accused of contributing to this pollution the information sphere. In this article, we argue that audiences with a counter-hegemonic, ideologically biased worldview are particularly likely to use alternative counter-news, because these outlets validate their worldview - and worldview validation being a relevant psychological need in times of crises. We suggest that by turning to alternative counter-news, audiences increase their exposure to fake news and end up being less well informed about important events. Results of a random-quota survey in Germany (N ¼ 967) confirmed that those with higher levels of conspiracy mentality and lower media trust were more likely to use alternative counter-news. Alternative counter-news users recalled more fake news than non-users and alternative counter-news use partially mediated the relationship between counter-hegemonic attitudes and fake news recall. Thus, although not all content in alternative counternews is fake news, these outlets do attract a specific counterhegemonic audience and they do contribute to the “pollution” of the information ecosystem.<br /></p>",alternative news media; alternative counter-news; authoritarianism; conspiracy mentality; coronavirus; COVID-19; differential susceptibility to media effects; fake news; trust,"['tree maps', ' carbon stocks', ' machine learning', ' deep learning']",en

However, a significant part of Star and Ruhleder’s original proposal has been overlooked—that infrastructure becomes a home for somebody. In this paper, we give an alternative interpretation of this relational view by focusing on the relation between a person and their infrastructure, rather than on the relation between technologies and practices. We use Heidegger’s (1927/1962) phenomenology in Being and Time to theorize what such a home might entail and a novel data collection method to study infrastructuring empirically from the perspective of a person. On this basis, we offer new theoretically grounded interpretations of infrastructure and infrastructuring. Empirically, we identify two modes of infrastructuring not previously distinguished. The perspective sheds new light on a number of key themes and debates in the literature and on infrastructuring in practice.<br /></p>",Infrastructure; infrastructuring; Heidegger; hermeneutic circle; reflective diary; empirical case,,en

In total, 3452 fake phishing e-mails were sent to 1276 public officials. Results show that the persuasion technique of Authority has worked best and therefore presumably poses the biggest threat to the information integrity of public sector agencies, followed by Urgency, Benefit and Danger.

82546178,Dealing with supply chain risks in tactical supply chain planning,"<p>

</p><p>The continuously growing occurrence of supply chain risks challenge the
effectiveness of tactical supply chain planning (TSCP). Consequently, an
adjustment of TSCP is required, for instance through integrating TSCP processes
with the four supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities of identifying,
assessing, treating, and monitoring supply chain risks. In this paper, it is
investigated how to deal with supply chain risks in TSCP through such an
integration with SCRM activities. Therefore, a scoping literature review of
TSCP literature is conducted. As a result, the literature is synthesized and
gaps in current research are identified.</p>

82553942,Process-Oriented Stream Classification Pipeline: A Literature Review,"<p>Due to the rise of continuous data-generating applications, analyzing data streams gained increasing attention over the past decades. A core research area in stream data is stream classification, which categorizes or detect data points within an evolving stream of observations. Areas of stream classification are diverse -- ranging, e.g., from monitoring sensor data to analyzing a wide range of (social) media applications. Research in stream classification is related to developing methods that adapt to the changing and potentially volatile data stream. It focuses on individual aspects of the stream classification pipeline, e.g., designing suitable algorithm architectures, an efficient train and test procedure, or detecting so-called concept drifts. </p><p>As a result of the many different research questions and strands, the field is challenging to grasp, especially for beginners. This survey explores, summarizes, and categorizes work within the domain of stream classification and identifies core research threads over the past years. It is structured based on the stream classification process to facilitate coordination within this complex topic, including common application scenarios and benchmarking data sets.

This is also true for the use of AI in relation to potential customers, policyholders, and beneficiaries. However, AI carries the risk of bias, a systematic forecasting error, and thus of discrimination. This interdisciplinary article examines the risk of bias and its causes from the perspective of computer science. Based on this, it discusses from a legal point of view the extent to which non-discrimination law applies in the case of bias and what the legal consequences are. The subsequent analysis of whether and how data scientists can technically eliminate bias leads to the legal question of how insurance supervisory law ensures that bias is avoided as far as possible. Finally, we examine the implications of the EU draft of an AI regulation for the avoidance of bias. How to cope with the assumed inevitability of bias is one of the important questions that future interdisciplinary research of information technology and insurance law has to solve.",Künstliche Intelligenz; Versicherungswirtschaft; Bias,,de

Supply chain analytics (SCA), the application of big data analytics to supply chain management, can enhance and innovate supply chain processes and services in most companies. To reap such benefits, supply chain managers must overcome various obstacles, including the identification of appropriate methods, data, and application cases. The degree to which the potential value of SCA actually is being harnessed by practitioners remains uncertain. The study aims to synthesize scientific and practical perspectives regarding the SCA dimensions: goal and motivation, method, data, and application area. For this purpose the research applies a multi-vocal literature review (MLR) and a survey approach. The study reviews over 1481 publications and consults 278 respondents to reveal six different goals and seven motivations for SCA. Moreover, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics and many different data types enabling SCA within different application areas are examined.

In this data-intense context, we have seen an increase in the number of non-technical users that need to query, explore, and make sense of large volumes of data. However, for these users, interacting with data becomes a tedious and time-consuming process. Furthermore, in cases where data is not readily available, users frequently make use of data marketplaces to acquire high-quality data. Nevertheless, current marketplaces offer almost no help to non-technical users. <br />In this thesis, we introduce a novel framework to enable users with limited technical expertise to conveniently (1) communicate their preferences and information needs, (2) formulate database queries without requiring them to be familiar with any query language, (3) evaluate data offers available in a data marketplace, and (4) manage the costs involved in issuing such queries to a marketplace in cases where the available budget is insufficient to embrace the complete target data set. The results obtained by the analyses reported in this thesis demonstrate that the proposed framework can produce near-optimum solutions and provide well-suited support to non-technical users in the tasks of query formulation and data purchase.<br /></p>",database; query formulation; query reverse engineering; data purchase; data marketplace; machine learning; non-technical users,,

This work sheds light on the effects that multi-objective optimization may have in the single-objective space. For this purpose, we examine the inner mechanisms of the recently developed sophisticated local search procedure SOMOGSA. This method solves multimodal single-objective continuous optimization problems based on first expanding the problem with an additional objective (e.g., a sphere function) to the bi-objective domain and subsequently exploiting local structures of the resulting landscapes. Our study particularly focuses on the sensitivity of this multiobjectivization approach w.r.t. (1) the parametrization of the artificial second objective, as well as (2) the position of the initial starting points in the search space. As SOMOGSA is a modular framework for encapsulating local search, we integrate Nelder–Mead local search as optimizer in the respective module and compare the performance of the resulting hybrid local search to its original single-objective counterpart. We show that the SOMOGSA framework can significantly boost local search by multiobjectivization. Hence, combined with more sophisticated local search and metaheuristics, this may help solve highly multimodal optimization problems in the future.<br /></p>",Multiobjectivization; Mulltimodal optimization; Continuous optimization; Local search,,en

In precision agriculture, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technologies are currently used to monitor crop growth, plant phenotyping, and biomass dynamics at the ecosystem scale. In this study, we utilized a UAV–LiDAR sensor to monitor two crop fields and a set of machine learning (ML) methods to predict real-time AGB over two consecutive years in the region of Mid-Jutland, Denmark. During each crop growing period, UAV surveys were conducted in parallel with AGB destructive sampling every 7–15 days, the AGB samples from which were used as the ground truth data. We evaluated the ability of the ML models to estimate the real-time values of AGB at a sub-meter resolution (0.17–0.52 m2). An extremely randomized trees (ERT) regressor was selected for the regression analysis, based on its predictive performance for the first year’s growing season. The model was retrained using previously identified hyperparameters to predict the AGB of the crops in the second year. The ERT performed AGB estimation using height and reflectance metrics from LiDAR-derived point cloud data and achieved a prediction performance of (Formula presented.) = 0.48 at a spatial resolution of 0.35 m2. The prediction performance could be improved significantly by aggregating adjacent predictions ((Formula presented.) = 0.71 and (Formula presented.) = 0.93 at spatial resolutions of 1 m2 and 2 m2, respectively) as they ultimately converged to the reference biomass values because any individual errors averaged out. The AGB prediction results were examined as function of predictor type, training set size, sampling resolution, phenology, and canopy density. The results demonstrated that when combined with ML regression methods, the UAV–LiDAR method could be used to provide accurate real-time AGB prediction for crop fields at a high resolution, thereby providing a way to map their biochemical constituents.",remote sensing; machine learning,,en

Specifically, we devise different neural network architectures for point cloud regression and evaluate them on remote sensing data of areas for which AGB estimates have been obtained from field measurements in a national forest inventory. Our adaptation of Minkowski convolutional neural networks for regression gave the best results. The deep neural networks produced significantly more accurate wood volume, AGB, and carbon estimates compared to state-of-the-art approaches operating on basic statistics of the point clouds. In contrast to other methods, no digital terrain model is required. We expect this finding to have a strong impact on LiDAR-based analyses of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics.",point cloud data; biomass estimation; deep learning,,en
82733697,Using high-resolution imagery and deep learning to classify land-use following deforestation: a case study in Ethiopia,"National-scale assessments of post-deforestation land-use are crucial for decreasing deforestation and forest degradation-related emissions. In this research, we assess the potential of different satellite data modalities (single-date, multi-date, multi-resolution, and an ensemble of multi-sensor images) for classifying land-use following deforestation in Ethiopia using the U-Net deep neural network architecture enhanced with attention. We performed the analysis on satellite image data retrieved across Ethiopia from freely available Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Planet-NICFI satellite data. The experiments aimed at an analysis of (a) single-date images from individual sensors to account for the differences in spatial resolution between image sensors in detecting land-uses, (b) ensembles of multiple images from different sensors (Planet-NICFI/Sentinel-2/Landsat-8) with different spatial resolutions, (c) the use of multi-date data to account for the contribution of temporal information in detecting land-uses, and, finally, (d) the identification of regional differences in terms of land-use following deforestation in Ethiopia. We hypothesize that choosing the right satellite imagery (sensor) type is crucial for the task. Based on a comprehensive visually interpreted reference dataset of 11 types of post-deforestation land-uses, we find that either detailed spatial patterns (single-date Planet-NICFI) or detailed temporal patterns (multi-date Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) are required for identifying land-use following deforestation, while medium-resolution single-date imagery is not sufficient to achieve high classification accuracy. We also find that adding soft-attention to the standard U-Net improved the classification accuracy, especially for small-scale land-uses. The models and products presented in this work can be used as a powerful data resource for governmental and forest monitoring agencies to design and monitor deforestation mitigation measures and data-driven land-use policy.",remote sensing; deep learning; satellite data; land-use; deforestation; Ethiopia,,en

We reconstruct how these complex platform business models were configured to improve patient care and care research, thereby creating immediate value for patients and insights for long-term care improvements. The ongoing platform development carefully balances value generation for diverse stakeholders and economic sustainability. <br /></p>","Digital health platform; business model; datafication; value based health; rare disease; care research; process

We begin by examining the perspectives of individual surgeons and lecturers and the relational, organizational, and institutional settings in which they are embedded. Recognizing and emphasizing the idiosyncrasies of these cases, we develop theoretical lenses that allow us to identify the dynamics of the transformation and patterns in reconfiguration work.</p><p>To investigate these illustrative cases of digital work and their implications, we employ two conceptual frames, 1) configuration work (Suchman, 2012), specifically emergent configurations of digital-human work, and 2) orders of change (Bartunek & Moch, 1987), emphasizing the role and development of frameworks in making sense of organizational change.<br /></p><p>We thus combine multi-faceted accounts of individuals' experiences of “figuring out” how to make digital work feasible with reflections on how the transformation of work affects the identities of individuals, organizations, and institutions. We propose that this transformation affects the ways in which we think about ourselves, our colleagues and employers, and the institutions that shape our work.<br /></p>",Digital work; Hidden work; Configuration; Liminal innovation; Robotic surgery; Zoom teaching,,
82752767,"Online, On Call, On Your Mind? Coping with Extensive Connectivity to Work","<p>Connectivity has become the hallmark of modern work and has also shaped the social life of many. Originating from a technical discourse, connectivity to work is reflected in numerous disciplinary discourses. While previous studies have identified negative effects for employees, the specific mechanisms which cause these effects are still poorly understood. The broadening of the term “connectivity” and the profound changes in the technical connectivity infrastructure require an adjusted conceptualization of connectivity, its structural causes and dimensions, how these dimensions interact, and how they explain different outcomes of connectivity. Based on a review of extant literature on connectivity and interviews with consultants, we develop a framework of connectivity that conceptualizes individual connectivity to work (social and technical) and its psychological impact (emotional, cognitive, behavioral). We derive extensive connectivity to work as a cause of strain. We develop two strategies, which allow employees to control extensive connectivity to work and cope with its effects.

82752916,Developing Ambidextrous Routines in the IT Service Provider Industry,"<p>This study explores ambidextrous practices and distinctive leadership styles in interorganizational settings of two German medium sized IT service providers. We draw on the theory of routines-as-practices and on the organizational ambidexterity literature to analyze organizational practices aiming at both potential for change (exploration) and stability (exploitation). We identify two distinct modes of contextual ambidexterity, whereby one capability is used to improve the other, i.e. ‘exploration for exploitation’, an orientation towards continually improving the quality of the service delivery, and ‘exploration through exploitation’, an approach of project-driven learning. We highlight and classify a multi-layered repertoire of ambidextrous routines across the three levels of analysis: leadership, project team, and client relations. Our findings illustrate elaborate management repertoires of interventions with respect to culture, structures, policies or practices, which are aligned with the ecosystem within which both companies are operating.</p><div><br /></div>",ambidexterity; routines; IT service provider,,

Given the environmental volatility and disruptions executives face today, we contend that reconfiguring through planning alone is impossible. Instead, as organizations encounter unexpected occurrences, they need to improvise with the means immediately at hand. In our study, we explore the intersection of DTS formation and improvisation. Drawing on Mintzberg and Waters’ (1985) strategy formation concept, we present a typology of three DTS formation approaches and analyze their viability for satisfying the demand for organizational improvisation in the DTS formation context. Our study contributes to the nascent discussion on strategic improvisation by shedding light on a crucial but latent layer of strategy-making that provides untapped insights for better understanding the mechanisms affecting DTS formation.<br />",Digital transformation; digital transformation strategy; improvisation; organizational improvisation,,en
82813832,Plotting Impossible? Surveying Visualization Methods for Continuous Multi-Objective Benchmark Problems,"<p>Traditionally, visualizing benchmark problems is an integral task in the domain of evolutionary algorithms development. Researchers get inspired for new search heuristics by challenges observed in functional landscapes. Moreover, landscape characteristics, features, and even terminology to describe them are derived from visualizations. And most importantly, benchmark designers need visualizations for identifying diverse problems that potentially challenge different aspects of optimization algorithms. As easy as it is to visualize single-objective problems, until recently there were hardly any approaches for gaining similar insights for multi-objective problems. Also, there have been no seamlessly accessible tools to support such visualizations.</p><p>This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the available visualization techniques from literature, including two interactive techniques to visualize three-dimensional problems, as well as two novel techniques which are suitable to scale some visualization properties to even higher-dimensional spaces. All presented techniques are integrated into a single tool, the moPLOT-dashboard, which enables users to perform landscape analyses in an interactive manner. Finally, the value of the tool and the visualizations is demonstrated in a series of usage scenarios on well-known benchmark problems.<br /></p>",Multi-Objective Optimization; Visualization; Multimodal Optimization; Benchmarks; Theory; Algorithms,,en
82818973,Design and Implementation of a Collaborative Idea Evaluation System,"Digital transformation is a complex endeavor with unforeseen pitfalls. However, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seem to struggle with digital transformation. To address this problem, governments have started initiatives, i.e., publicly-funded support units, with the purpose to support digital transformation through facilitating idea management in SMEs. Studies suggest that the application of (IT-based) idea evaluation systems could impact the digital transformation success of SMEs. However, contributions addressing the interplay of support units and SMEs in the context of idea evaluation are scarce. Therefore, this article addresses the following problems (1) SMEs require external support in the context of digital transformation, and (2) idea evaluation is often improperly executed. Bringing together these areas leads to the objective to design and implement a collaborative idea evaluation system. The system development follows the methodological pathway for design science research. Observations from seven small-scale projects with SMEs complemented with selected literature inform the system design. Two focus group discussions serve as an evaluation of the system. The results are a set of design features and an interaction concept. Finally, a prototypical web application puts the conceptual design into action to tackle the identified practical problem.",Idea management; Software design; Digital transformation; Idea evaluation; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Publicly-funded support units,,

For the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) a plethora of features have been suggested. Most of these features are, if at all, only normalized imprecisely raising the issue of feature values being strongly affected by the instance size. Such artifacts may have detrimental effects on algorithm selection models.</p><p>We propose a normalization for two feature groups that stood out in multiple AS studies on the TSP: (a) features based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) and (b) nearest neighbor relationships of the input instance. To this end, we theoretically derive minimum and maximum values for properties of MSTs and <i>k</i>-nearest neighbor graphs (NNG) of Euclidean graphs. We analyze the differences in feature space between normalized versions of these features and their unnormalized counterparts. Our empirical investigations on various TSP benchmark sets point out that feature scaling succeeds in eliminating the effect of the instance size. A proof-of-concept AS-study shows promising results: models trained with normalized features tend to outperform those trained with the respective vanilla features.</p>",Feature normalization; Algorithm selection; Traveling salesperson problem,,en

predominance of trees outside forests and limited resources make it 
difficult for many developing countries to conduct automated nation-wide
 inventories. Here, we propose an approach to map the carbon stock of 
each individual overstory tree at the national scale of Rwanda using 
aerial imagery from 2008 and deep learning. We show that 72% of the 
mapped trees are located in farmlands and savannas, and 17% in 
plantations, accounting for 48.6% of the national aboveground carbon 
stocks. Natural forests cover 11% of the total tree count, and 51.4% of 
the national carbon stocks, with an overall carbon stock uncertainty of 
16.9%. The mapping of all trees allows partitioning to any landscapes 
classification and is urgently needed for effective planning and 
monitoring of restoration activities as well as for optimization of 
carbon sequestration, biodiversity and economic benefits of trees.</p>",tree maps; carbon stocks; machine learning; deep learning,,en
83091577,Discovering Vulnerabilities and Patches for Open Source Security,"Open source software is used in numerous systems and security vulnerabilities in such software often affect many targets at once. Hence, it is crucial to find security vulnerabilities as soon as possible. A convenient method to check software for vulnerabilities is executing a static code analysis tool before deployment. However, for verifying the reliability of such tools, real-world data including labeled non-vulnerable and vulnerable code is required.<br />This paper introduces an approach to automatically create and enhance a labeled data set of open source projects. The ground truth of vulnerabilities is extracted from up-to-date CVEs. We identify repositories related to known vulnerabilities, select vulnerable versions and take patch commits into account. In this context, we utilize Gradient Boosting based on regression trees as a meta classifier for associating patch commits to CWE categories. With a high precision of this matching, we give insights about the impact of certain vulnerabilities and a general overview of open source code security. Our findings may be used for future studies, such as the impact of certain code design criteria, e.g. clean code, on the prevalence of vulnerabilities.<br />","Web Security, Data Set Generation, Commit Classification",,en
83091898,Improving the Performance of Opportunistic Networks in Real World Applications Using Machine Learning Techniques,"<p>In Opportunistic Networks, portable devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables carried by individuals, can communicate and save-carry-forward their messages. The message transmission is often in short-range supported by communication protocols, such as Bluetooth,  Bluetooth Low Energy, and Zigbee.<br />These devices carried by individuals along with a city's taxis and buses represent network nodes.<br />The mobility, buffer size, message interval, number of nodes, and number of messages copied in such a network influence the network's performance. Although extending these factors can improve the delivery of the messages and, consequently, network performance; However, due to the limited network resources, it increases the cost and appends the network overhead. The network delivers the maximized performance when supported by the optimal factors. In this paper, We measured, predicted, and analyzed the impact of these factors on network performance using the Opportunistic Network Environment simulator and machine learning techniques. We calculated the optimal factors depending on the network features. We have used three datasets, each with features and characteristics reflecting different network structures.<br />We collected the real-time GPS coordinates of 500 taxis in San Francisco, 320 taxis in Rome, and 196 public transportation buses in Münster, Germany, within 48 hours. We also compared the network performance without selfish nodes and with 5%, 10%, 20%, and 50%  selfish nodes. We suggested the optimized configuration under real-world conditions when resources are limited. In addition, we compared the performance of Epidemic, Prophet, and PPHB++ routing algorithms fed with the optimized factors. The results show how to consider the best settings for the network according to the needs and how self-sustaining nodes will affect network performance.<br /></p>","Opportunistic Networks; Selfish nodes; Buffer size; Nodes movement, Nodes density",,
83198740,Blossom: Cluster-Based Routing for Preserving Privacy in Opportunistic Networks,"Opportunistic networks are an enabler technology for typologies without centralized infrastructure. Portable devices, such as wearable and embedded mobile systems, send relay messages to the communication range devices. One of the most critical challenges is to find the optimal route in these networks while at the same time preserving privacy for the participants of the network. Addressing this challenge, we presented a novel routing algorithm based on device clusters, reducing the overall message load and increasing network performance. At the same time, possibly identifying information of network nodes is eliminated by cloaking to meet privacy requirements. We evaluated our routing algorithm in terms of efficiency and privacy in opportunistic networks of traditional and structured cities, i.e., Venice and San Francisco by comparing our approach against the PRoPHET,  First Contact, and  Epidemic routing algorithms.<br />In the San Francisco and Venice scenarios, Blossom improves messages delivery probability and outperforms PRoPHET,  First Contact, and Epidemic by 46%, 100%, and 160% and by 67%, 78%, and 204%, respectively. In addition, the dropped messages probability in Blossom decreased 83% compared to PRoPHET and Epidemic in San Francisco and 91% compared to PRoPHET and Epidemic in Venice. Due to the small number of messages generated, the network overhead in this algorithm is close to zero. The network overhead can be significantly reduced by clustering while maintaining a reliable message delivery.",opportunistic network;  privacy-preserving routing; cluster-based routing; cloaking,,

83315959,MOLE: Digging Tunnels Through Multimodal Multi-Objective Landscapes,"Recent advances in the visualization of continuous multimodal multi-objective optimization (MMMOO) landscapes brought a new perspective to their search dynamics. Locally eficient (LE) sets, often considered as traps for local search, are rarely isolated in the decision space. Rather, intersections by superposing attraction basins lead to further solution sets that at least partially contain better solutions. The Multi-Objective Gradient Sliding Algorithm (MOGSA) is an algorithmic concept developed to exploit these superpositions. While it has promising performance on many MMMOO problems with linear LE sets, closer analysis of MOGSA revealed that it does not sufficiently generalize to a wider set of test problems. Based on a detailed analysis of shortcomings of MOGSA, we propose a new algorithm, the Multi-Objective Landscape Explorer (MOLE). It is able to efficiently model and exploit LE sets in MMMOO problems. An implementation of MOLE is presented for the bi-objective case, and the practicality of the approach is shown in a benchmarking experiment on the Bi-Objective BBOB testbed.",continuous optimization; local search; heuristics; multimodality; multi-objective optimization,,en
